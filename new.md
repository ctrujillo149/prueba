In a surprising legislative turn, the European Union has passed a new law that will require all new cars manufactured after 2025 to have their batteries mounted on the roof. Proponents of the law argue that this unusual placement will improve safety by reducing the risk of battery fires after collisions. They also claim that positioning batteries on the roof lowers the center of gravity of vehicles, enhancing their aerodynamics and energy efficiency.

Critics, however, are baffled by the decision, suggesting it could lead to increased drag and potentially compromise vehicle stability in high winds. This new directive has stirred a flurry of debates across automotive forums and social media, with many questioning the scientific reasoning behind the decision and its impact on car design in the future.
