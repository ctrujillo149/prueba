DIRECTIVE (EU) 2017/2102 OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL

of 15 November 2017

amending Directive 2011/65/EU on the restriction of the use of certain hazardous substances in electrical and electronic equipment

(Text with EEA relevance)

THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,

Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, and in particular Article 114 thereof,

Having regard to the proposal from the European Commission,

After transmission of the draft legislative act to the national parliaments,

Having regard to the opinion of the European Economic and Social Committee (1),

After consulting the Committee of the Regions,

Acting in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure (2),

Whereas:

(1)

Directive 2011/65/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council (3) on the restriction of the use of certain hazardous substances in electrical and electronic equipment (EEE) contains a request that the Commission examine the need to amend the scope of that Directive in respect of the EEE covered therein and, if appropriate, present a legislative proposal with respect to any additional exclusions related to that EEE.

(2)

Secondary market operations for EEE, which involve repair, replacement of spare parts, refurbishment and reuse, and retrofitting, should be facilitated to promote a circular economy in the Union. A high level of protection of human health and the environment should be ensured, including through the environmentally sound recovery and disposal of waste EEE. Any unnecessary administrative burden on market operators should be avoided. Directive 2011/65/EU allows EEE that fell outside the scope of the previous Directive 2002/95/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council (4), but which would not comply with Directive 2011/65/EU, to continue to be made available on the market until 22 July 2019. After that date, however, both the first placing on the market and secondary market operations of non-compliant EEE are prohibited. Such prohibition of secondary market operations is inconsistent with the general principles underlying Union measures for the approximation of laws relating to products and should therefore be removed.

(3)

Certain niche product groups should be excluded from the scope of Directive 2011/65/EU as their inclusion would bring negligible environmental or health benefits and introduce unresolvable compliance problems or market distortions that cannot effectively be addressed through the exemption mechanism provided for in that Directive.

(4)

Pipes in organs are built using a specific type of lead-based alloy, for which no alternative has been found so far. Most pipe organs are kept in the same place for centuries and their turnover rate is negligible. Pipe organs should therefore be excluded from the scope of Directive 2011/65/EU as their inclusion would bring negligible benefit in terms of the substitution of lead.

(5)

Directive 2011/65/EU does not apply to non-road mobile machinery with an on-board power source, which is made available exclusively for professional use. However, for certain types of non-road mobile machinery, two versions are produced in the same production line, with the power source (either on-board or external) being the only difference. Those versions should be treated in the same way under that Directive. Non-road mobile machinery with a traction drive powered by an external power source should therefore also be excluded from the scope of Directive 2011/65/EU.

(6)

For all relevant EEE categories, as set out in Annex I to Directive 2011/65/EU, the conditions for the exemption of reused spare parts, recovered from EEE, should be clearly specified. Likewise, since exemptions from the restriction of the use of certain hazardous substances should have a limited duration, the maximum validity period for existing exemptions should also be clearly specified for all relevant EEE categories, including for category 11.

(7)

When an application for renewal of an exemption is submitted, the Commission is required to take a decision no later than 6 months before the expiry date of the existing exemption, unless specific circumstances justify a different deadline. No deadline is specified for the Commission to take a decision on applications for new exemptions. According to the report of 18 April 2016 from the Commission to the European Parliament and the Council on the exercise of the power to adopt delegated acts conferred on the Commission pursuant to Directive 2011/65/EU, that deadline has proven to be unfeasible in practice, due to the need to follow several mandatory procedural steps for the evaluation of an application for renewal of an exemption. While the deadline brings no additional value to the existing procedure for the evaluation of applications for renewal, it entails uncertainties for businesses and other stakeholders due to its impracticability. On the other hand, business continuity is ensured since market operators are able to rely on an existing exemption remaining valid until a decision is taken on the application for renewal. Therefore, the provision related to the deadline should be removed. However, the Commission should provide to the applicant, the Member States and the European Parliament, shortly after the receipt of an application, a timeline for the adoption of its decision on the application. Furthermore, the general review of Directive 2011/65/EU to be carried out by the Commission no later than 22 July 2021 should include the specification of a realistic deadline for a decision by the Commission on an application for renewal of an exemption before the expiry of the relevant exemption.

(8)

Since the objectives of this Directive, which are to contribute to the protection of human health and the environmentally sound recovery and disposal of waste EEE by means of the restriction of the use of hazardous substances in EEE, cannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member States because disparities between the laws or administrative measures adopted by the Member States could create barriers to trade and distort competition in the Union and thus have a direct impact on the internal market, but can rather, by reason of the scale of the problem and its implications in respect of other Union legislation on recovery and disposal of waste and areas of common interest, such as human health protection, be better achieved at Union level, the Union may adopt measures, in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity as set out in Article 5 of the Treaty on European Union. In accordance with the principle of proportionality as set out in that Article, this Directive does not go beyond what is necessary in order to achieve those objectives,

COMMISSION DELEGATED DIRECTIVE (EU) 2015/863

of 31 March 2015

amending Annex II to Directive 2011/65/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council as regards the list of restricted substances

(Text with EEA relevance)

THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION,

Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union,

Having regard to Directive 2011/65/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council of 8 June 2011 on the restriction of the use of certain hazardous substances in electrical and electronic equipment, (1) and in particular Article 6(3) thereof,

Whereas:

(1)

Directive 2011/65/EU lays down rules on the restriction of the use of hazardous substances in electrical and electronic equipment (EEE) with a view to contributing to the protection of human health and the environment, including the environmentally sound recovery and disposal of waste EEE.

(2)

Directive 2011/65/EU prohibits the use of lead, mercury, cadmium, hexavalent chromium, polybrominated biphenyls (PBB) and polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDE) in electrical and electronic equipment placed on the Union market. Annex II to that Directive lists those restricted substances.

(3)

The risks to human health and the environment arising from the use of Hexabromocyclododecane (HBCDD), Bis(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP), Butyl benzyl phthalate (BBP) and Dibutyl phthalate (DBP) should be considered a priority in the periodic review of the list of restricted substances in Annex II. With a view to further restrictions, the substances that were subject to previous assessments should be re-investigated.

(4)

In accordance with Article 6(1) of Directive 2011/65/EU, interested parties, including economic operators, recyclers, treatment operators, environmental organisations and employee and consumer associations, have been consulted and a thorough assessment has been performed.

(5)

Bis(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP), Butyl benzyl phthalate (BBP), Dibutyl phthalate (DBP) and Diisobutyl phthalate (DIBP) are substances of very high concern (SVHC). DIBP is a substance that can be used as a substitute for DBP and was subject to previous assessments performed by the Commission. The available evidence indicates that those four substances, when used in EEE, can have a negative impact on recycling and on human health and the environment during EEE waste management operations.

(6)

Substitutes that have less negative impacts are available for DEHP, BBP, DBP and DIBP in most EEE. The use of those substances in EEE should therefore be restricted. DEHP, BBP and DBP are already restricted through entry 51 of Annex XVII to Regulation (EC) No 1907/2006 of the European Parliament and of the Council, (2) so that toys containing DEHP, BBP or DBP in a concentration greater than 0,1 % by weight of the plasticised material, calculated for the three phthalates cumulatively, cannot be placed on the EU market. In order to avoid double regulation, the restriction through entry 51 of Annex XVII to that Regulation shall therefore continue to be the only restriction applicable to DEHP, BBP and DBP in toys.

(7)

In order to facilitate transition and to mitigate possible socioeconomic impacts, an appropriate transition period should be granted, which will allow economic operators to apply for exemptions from the substance restrictions in accordance with Article 5 of Directive 2011/65/EU. The longer innovation cycles for medical devices and monitoring and control instruments should be taken into account while determining the transitional period. The restriction of the use of DEHP, BBP, DBP and DIBP should therefore apply to medical devices, including in vitro medical devices, and monitoring and control instruments, including industrial monitoring and control instruments, from 22 July 2021.

(8)

Any adaptation of Annex III or IV to Directive 2011/65/EU to exempt applications in relation to DEHP or DBP should take place in a manner which, in order to avoid double regulation and unnecessary burden, ensures coherence with the administration of any authorisation granted under Regulation (EC) No 1907/2006 in relation to the incorporation of those substances in EEE. Operators considering whether to apply for exemptions under Directive 2011/65/EU should be aware that such exemptions may cover the entire life cycle of the EEE, including the manufacturing phase.

(9)

Directive 2011/65/EU should therefore be amended accordingly,

HAS ADOPTED THIS DIRECTIVE:

Article 1

Annex II to Directive 2011/65/EU is replaced by the text in the Annex to this Directive.

when supplying a new product, distributors are responsible for ensuring that such waste can be returned to the distributor at least free of charge on a one-to-one basis as long as the equipment is of equivalent type and has fulfilled the same functions as the supplied equipment. Member States may derogate from this provision provided that they ensure that returning the WEEE is not thereby made more difficult for the final holder and that it remains free of charge for the final holder. Member States making use of this derogation shall inform the Commission thereof;

(c) 
distributors provide for the collection, at retail shops with sales areas relating to EEE of at least 400 m2, or in their immediate proximity, of very small WEEE (no external dimension more than 25 cm) free of charge to end-users and with no obligation to buy EEE of an equivalent type, unless an assessment shows that alternative existing collection schemes are likely to be at least as effective. Such assessments shall be available to the public. WEEE collected shall be properly treated in accordance with Article 8;

(d) 
without prejudice to points (a), (b) and (c), producers are allowed to set up and to operate individual and/or collective take-back systems for WEEE from private households provided that these are in line with the objectives of this Directive;

(e) 
having regard to national and Union health and safety standards, WEEE that presents a health and safety risk to personnel because of contamination may be refused for return under points (a), (b) and (c). Member States shall make specific arrangements for such WEEE.

Member States may provide for specific arrangements for the return of WEEE pursuant to points (a), (b) and (c) for cases in which the equipment does not contain its essential components or if the equipment contains waste other than WEEE.

3.   Member States may designate the operators that are allowed to collect WEEE from private households as referred to in paragraph 2.
4.   Member States may require that the WEEE deposited at collection facilities referred to in paragraphs 2 and 3 is handed over to producers or third parties acting on their behalf or is handed over, for purposes of preparing for re-use, to designated establishments or undertakings.
5.   In the case of WEEE other than WEEE from private households, and without prejudice to Article 13, Member States shall ensure that producers or third parties acting on their behalf provide for the collection of such waste.
Article 6

Disposal and transport of collected WEEE

1.   Member States shall prohibit the disposal of separately collected WEEE which has not yet undergone the treatment specified in Article 8.
2.   Member States shall ensure that the collection and transport of separately collected WEEE is carried out in a way which allows optimal conditions for preparing for re-use, recycling and the confinement of hazardous substances.
In order to maximise preparing for re-use, Member States shall promote that, prior to any further transfer, collection schemes or facilities provide, where appropriate, for the separation at the collection points of WEEE that is to be prepared for re-use from other separately collected WEEE, in particular by granting access for personnel from re-use centres.

Article 7

Collection rate

1.   Without prejudice to Article 5(1), each Member State shall ensure the implementation of the ‘producer responsibility’ principle and, on that basis, that a minimum collection rate is achieved annually. From 2016, the minimum collection rate shall be 45 % calculated on the basis of the total weight of WEEE collected in accordance with Articles 5 and 6 in a given year in the Member State concerned, expressed as a percentage of the average weight of EEE placed on the market in the three preceding years in that Member State. Member States shall ensure that the volume of WEEE collected evolves gradually during the period from 2016 to 2019, unless the collection rate laid down in the second subparagraph has already been achieved.
From 2019, the minimum collection rate to be achieved annually shall be 65 % of the average weight of EEE placed on the market in the three preceding years in the Member State concerned, or alternatively 85 % of WEEE generated on the territory of that Member State.

Until 31 December 2015, a rate of separate collection of at least 4 kilograms on average per inhabitant per year of WEEE from private households or the same amount of weight of WEEE as was collected in that Member State on average in the three preceding years, whichever is greater, shall continue to apply.

Member States may set more ambitious rates for separate collection of WEEE and shall in such a case report this to the Commission.

2.   In order to establish whether the minimum collection rate has been achieved, Member States shall ensure that information concerning the WEEE that is separately collected in accordance with Article 5 is transmitted to the Member States free of charge, including at least information on WEEE that has been:
(a) 
received by collection and treatment facilities;

(b) 
received by distributors;

(c) 
separately collected by producers or third parties acting on their behalf.

3.   By way of derogation from paragraph 1, Bulgaria, the Czech Republic, Latvia, Lithuania, Hungary, Malta, Poland, Romania, Slovenia and Slovakia may, because of their lack of the necessary infrastructure and their low level of EEE consumption, decide to:
(a) 
achieve, from 14 August 2016, a collection rate that is lower than 45 % but higher than 40 % of the average weight of EEE placed on the market in the three preceding years; and

(b) 
postpone the achievement of the collection rate referred to in the second subparagraph of paragraph 1 until a date of their own choice which shall not be later than 14 August 2021.

4.   The Commission shall be empowered to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 20 laying down the necessary transitional adjustments in order to address difficulties faced by Member States in adhering to the requirements laid down in paragraph 1.
5.   In order to ensure uniform conditions for the implementation of this Article, the Commission shall, by 14 August 2015, adopt implementing acts establishing a common methodology for the calculation of the weight of EEE placed on the national market and a common methodology for the calculation of the quantity of WEEE generated by weight in each Member State. Those implementing acts shall be adopted in accordance with the examination procedure referred to in Article 21(2).
6.   The Commission shall, by 14 August 2015, present a report to the European Parliament and to the Council on the re-examination of the deadlines relating to the collection rates referred to in paragraph 1 and on possibly setting individual collection rates for one or more categories set out in Annex III, particularly for temperature exchange equipment, photovoltaic panels, small equipment, small IT and telecommunication equipment and lamps containing mercury. The report shall, if appropriate, be accompanied by a legislative proposal.
7.   If the Commission considers, on the basis of an impact study, that the collection rate based on WEEE generated requires revision, it shall submit a legislative proposal to the European Parliament and the Council.
Article 8

Proper treatment

1.   Member States shall ensure that all separately collected WEEE undergoes proper treatment.
2.   Proper treatment, other than preparing for re-use, and recovery or recycling operations shall, as a minimum, include the removal of all fluids and a selective treatment in accordance with Annex VII.
3.   Member States shall ensure that producers or third parties acting on their behalf set up systems to provide for the recovery of WEEE using best available techniques. The systems may be set up by producers individually or collectively. Member States shall ensure that any establishment or undertaking carrying out collection or treatment operations stores and treats WEEE in compliance with the technical requirements set out in Annex VIII.
4.   The Commission shall be empowered to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 20 concerning the amendment of Annex VII in order to introduce other treatment technologies that ensure at least the same level of protection for human health and the environment.
The Commission shall evaluate, as a matter of priority, whether the entries regarding printed circuit boards for mobile phones and liquid crystal displays need to be amended. The Commission is invited to evaluate whether amendments to Annex VII are necessary to address nanomaterials contained in EEE.

5.   For the purposes of environmental protection, Member States may set up minimum quality standards for the treatment of the WEEE that has been collected.
Member States which opt for such quality standards shall inform the Commission thereof, which shall publish these standards.

The Commission shall, not later than 14 February 2013, request the European standardisation organisations to develop European standards for the treatment, including recovery, recycling and preparing for re-use, of WEEE. Those standards shall reflect the state of the art.

In order to ensure uniform conditions for the implementation of this Article, the Commission may adopt implementing acts laying down minimum quality standards based in particular on the standards developed by the European standardisation organisations. Those implementing acts shall be adopted in accordance with the examination procedure referred to in Article 21(2).

A reference to the standards adopted by the Commission shall be published.

6.   Member States shall encourage establishments or undertakings which carry out treatment operations to introduce certified environmental management systems in accordance with Regulation (EC) No 1221/2009 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 25 November 2009 on the voluntary participation by organisations in a Community eco-management and audit scheme (EMAS) ( 6 ).
Article 9

Permits

1.   Member States shall ensure that any establishment or undertaking carrying out treatment operations obtains a permit from the competent authorities in compliance with Article 23 of Directive 2008/98/EC.
2.   Exemptions from permit requirements, conditions for exemptions and registration shall be in compliance, respectively, with Articles 24, 25 and 26 of Directive 2008/98/EC.
3.   Member States shall ensure that the permit or the registration referred to in paragraphs 1 and 2 includes all the conditions that are necessary for compliance with the requirements of Article 8(2), (3) and (5) and for the achievement of the recovery targets set out in Article 11.
Article 10

Shipments of WEEE

1.   The treatment operation may also be undertaken outside the respective Member State or the Union provided that the shipment of WEEE is in compliance with Regulation (EC) No 1013/2006 and Commission Regulation (EC) No 1418/2007 of 29 November 2007 concerning the export for recovery of certain waste listed in Annex III or IIIA to Regulation (EC) No 1013/2006 of the European Parliament and of the Council to certain countries to which the OECD Decision on the control of transboundary movements of wastes does not apply ( 7 ).
2.   WEEE exported out of the Union shall only count towards the fulfilment of obligations and targets set out in Article 11 of this Directive if, in compliance with Regulations (EC) No 1013/2006 and (EC) No 1418/2007, the exporter can prove that the treatment took place in conditions that are equivalent to the requirements of this Directive.
3.   The Commission shall, not later than 14 February 2014, adopt delegated acts, in accordance with Article 20, laying down detailed rules supplementing those in paragraph 2 of this Article, in particular the criteria for the assessment of equivalent conditions.
Article 11

Recovery targets

1.   Regarding all WEEE separately collected in accordance with Article 5 and sent for treatment in accordance with Articles 8, 9 and 10, Member States shall ensure that producers meet the minimum targets set out in Annex V.
2.   The achievement of the targets shall be calculated, for each category, by dividing the weight of the WEEE that enters the recovery or recycling/preparing for re-use facility, after proper treatment in accordance with Article 8(2) with regard to recovery or recycling, by the weight of all separately collected WEEE for each category, expressed as a percentage.
Preliminary activities including sorting and storage prior to recovery shall not count towards the achievement of these targets.

3.   In order to ensure uniform conditions for the implementation of this Article, the Commission may adopt implementing acts establishing additional rules on the calculation methods for the application of the minimum targets. Those implementing acts shall be adopted in accordance with the examination procedure referred to in Article 21(2).
4.   Member States shall ensure that, for the purpose of calculating these targets, producers or third parties acting on their behalf keep records on the weight of WEEE, its components, materials or substances when leaving (output) the collection facility, entering (input) and leaving (output) the treatment facilities and when entering (input) the recovery or recycling/preparing for re-use facility.
Member States shall also ensure that, for the purposes of paragraph 6, records on the weight of products and materials when leaving (output) the recovery or recycling/preparing for re-use facility are kept.

5.   Member States shall encourage the development of new recovery, recycling and treatment technologies.
6.   On the basis of a report of the Commission accompanied, if appropriate, by a legislative proposal, the European Parliament and the Council shall, by 14 August 2016, re-examine the recovery targets referred to in Annex V, Part 3, examine the possibility of setting separate targets for WEEE to be prepared for re-use and re-examine the calculation method referred to in paragraph 2 with a view to analysing the feasibility of setting targets on the basis of products and materials resulting (output) from the recovery, recycling and preparation for re-use processes.
Article 12

Financing in respect of WEEE from private households

1.   Member States shall ensure that producers provide at least for the financing of the collection, treatment, recovery and environmentally sound disposal of WEEE from private households that has been deposited at collection facilities set up under Article 5(2).
2.   Member States may, where appropriate, encourage producers to finance also the costs occurring for collection of WEEE from private households to collection facilities.
3.   For products placed on the market later than 13 August 2005, each producer shall be responsible for financing the operations referred to in paragraph 1 relating to the waste from his own products. The producer may choose to fulfil this obligation either individually or by joining a collective scheme.
Member States shall ensure that each producer provides a guarantee when placing a product on the market showing that the management of all WEEE will be financed and shall ensure that producers clearly mark their products in accordance with Article 15(2). This guarantee shall ensure that the operations referred to in paragraph 1 relating to this product will be financed. The guarantee may take the form of participation by the producer in appropriate schemes for the financing of the management of WEEE, a recycling insurance or a blocked bank account.

4.   The responsibility for the financing of the costs of the management of WEEE from products placed on the market on or before 13 August 2005 (‘historical waste’) shall be borne by one or more systems to which all producers existing on the market when the respective costs occur contribute proportionately, e.g. in proportion to their respective share of the market by type of equipment.
5.   Member States shall take the necessary measures to ensure that appropriate mechanisms or refund procedures are developed for the reimbursement of contributions to the producers where EEE is transferred for placing on the market outside the territory of the Member State concerned. Such mechanisms or procedures may be developed by producers or third parties acting on their behalf.
6.   The Commission is invited to report, by 14 August 2015, on the possibility of developing criteria to incorporate the real end-of-life costs into the financing of WEEE by producers, and to submit a legislative proposal to the European Parliament and the Council if appropriate.
Article 13

Financing in respect of WEEE from users other than private households

1.   Member States shall ensure that the financing of the costs for the collection, treatment, recovery and environmentally sound disposal of WEEE from users other than private households resulting from products placed on the market after 13 August 2005 is to be provided for by producers.
For historical waste being replaced by new equivalent products or by new products fulfilling the same function, the financing of the costs shall be provided for by producers of those products when supplying them. Member States may, as an alternative, provide that users other than private households also be made, partly or totally, responsible for this financing.

For other historical waste, the financing of the costs shall be provided for by the users other than private households.

2.   Producers and users other than private households may, without prejudice to this Directive, conclude agreements stipulating other financing methods.
Article 14

Information for users

1.   Member States may require producers to show purchasers, at the time of sale of new products, the costs of collection, treatment and disposal in an environmentally sound way. The costs mentioned shall not exceed the best estimate of the actual costs incurred.
2.   Member States shall ensure that users of EEE in private households are given the necessary information about:
(a) 
the requirement not to dispose of WEEE as unsorted municipal waste and to collect such WEEE separately;

(b) 
the return and collection systems available to them, encouraging the coordination of information on the available collection points irrespective of the producers or other operators which have set them up;

(c) 
their role in contributing to re-use, recycling and other forms of recovery of WEEE;

(d) 
the potential effects on the environment and human health as a result of the presence of hazardous substances in EEE;

(e) 
the meaning of the symbol shown in Annex IX.

3.   Member States shall adopt appropriate measures so that consumers participate in the collection of WEEE and to encourage them to facilitate the process of re-use, treatment and recovery.
4.   With a view to minimising the disposal of WEEE as unsorted municipal waste and to facilitating its separate collection, Member States shall ensure that producers appropriately mark — preferably in accordance with the European standard EN 50419 ( 8 ) — EEE placed on the market with the symbol shown in Annex IX. In exceptional cases, where this is necessary because of the size or the function of the product, the symbol shall be printed on the packaging, on the instructions for use and on the warranty of the EEE.
5.   Member States may require that some or all of the information referred to in paragraphs 2, 3 and 4 shall be provided by producers and/or distributors, e.g. in the instructions for use, at the point of sale and through public awareness campaigns.
Article 15

Information for treatment facilities

1.   In order to facilitate the preparation for re-use and the correct and environmentally sound treatment of WEEE, including maintenance, upgrade, refurbishment and recycling, Member States shall take the necessary measures to ensure that producers provide information free of charge about preparation for re-use and treatment in respect of each type of new EEE placed for the first time on the Union market within one year after the equipment is placed on the market. This information shall identify, as far as it is needed by centres which prepare for re-use and treatment and recycling facilities in order to comply with the provisions of this Directive, the different EEE components and materials, as well as the location of dangerous substances and mixtures in EEE. It shall be made available to centres which prepare for re-use and treatment and recycling facilities by producers of EEE in the form of manuals or by means of electronic media (e.g. CD-ROM, online services).
2.   In order to enable the date upon which the EEE was placed on the market to be determined unequivocally, Member States shall ensure that a mark on the EEE specifies that the latter was placed on the market after 13 August 2005. Preferably, the European Standard EN 50419 shall be applied for this purpose.
Article 16

Registration, information and reporting

1.   Member States shall, in accordance with paragraph 2, draw up a register of producers, including producers supplying EEE by means of distance communication. That register shall serve to monitor compliance with the requirements of this Directive.
Producers supplying EEE by means of distance communication as defined in Article 3(1)(f)(iv) shall be registered in the Member State that they sell to. Where such producers are not registered in the Member State that they are selling to, they shall be registered through their authorised representatives as referred to in Article 17(2).

2.   Member States shall ensure that:
(a) 
each producer, or each authorised representative where appointed under Article 17, is registered as required and has the possibility of entering online in their national register all relevant information reflecting that producer’s activities in that Member State;

(b) 
upon registering, each producer, or each authorised representative where appointed under Article 17, provides the information set out in Annex X, Part A, undertaking to update it as appropriate;

(c) 
each producer, or each authorised representative where appointed under Article 17, provides the information set out in Annex X, Part B;

(d) 
national registers provide links to other national registers on their website to facilitate, in all Member States, registration of producers or, where appointed under Article 17, authorised representatives.

3.   In order to ensure uniform conditions for the implementation of this Article, the Commission shall adopt implementing acts establishing the format for registration and reporting and the frequency of reporting to the register. Those implementing acts shall be adopted in accordance with the examination procedure referred to in Article 21(2).
4.   Member States shall collect information, including substantiated estimates, on an annual basis, on the quantities and categories of EEE placed on their markets, collected through all routes, prepared for re-use, recycled and recovered within the Member State, and on separately collected WEEE exported, by weight.

ANNEX VI

MINIMUM REQUIREMENTS FOR SHIPMENTS

1. In order to distinguish between EEE and WEEE, where the holder of the object claims that he intends to ship or is shipping used EEE and not WEEE, Member States shall require the holder to have available the following to substantiate this claim:

(a) 
a copy of the invoice and contract relating to the sale and/or transfer of ownership of the EEE which states that the equipment is destined for direct re-use and that it is fully functional;

(b) 
evidence of evaluation or testing in the form of a copy of the records (certificate of testing, proof of functionality) on every item within the consignment and a protocol containing all record information according to point 3;

(c) 
a declaration made by the holder who arranges the transport of the EEE that none of the material or equipment within the consignment is waste as defined by Article 3(1) of Directive 2008/98/EC; and

(d) 
appropriate protection against damage during transportation, loading and unloading in particular through sufficient packaging and appropriate stacking of the load.

2. By way of derogation, point 1(a) and (b) and point 3 do not apply where it is documented by conclusive proof that the shipment is taking place in the framework of a business-to-business transfer agreement and that:

(a) 
the EEE is sent back to the producer or a third party acting on his behalf as defective for repair under warranty with the intention of re-use; or

(b) 
the used EEE for professional use is sent to the producer or a third party acting on his behalf or a third-party facility in countries to which Decision C(2001)107/Final of the OECD Council concerning the revision of Decision C(92)39/Final on control of transboundary movements of wastes destined for recovery operations applies, for refurbishment or repair under a valid contract with the intention of re-use; or

(c) 
the defective used EEE for professional use, such as medical devices or their parts, is sent to the producer or a third party acting on his behalf for root cause analysis under a valid contract, in cases where such an analysis can only be conducted by the producer or third parties acting on his behalf.

3. In order to demonstrate that the items being shipped constitute used EEE rather than WEEE, Member States shall require the following steps for testing and record keeping for used EEE to be carried out:

Step 1: Testing
(a) 
Functionality shall be tested and the presence of hazardous substances shall be evaluated. The tests to be conducted depend on the kind of EEE. For most of the used EEE a functionality test of the key functions is sufficient.

(b) 
Results of evaluation and testing shall be recorded.

Step 2: Record
(a) 
The record shall be fixed securely but not permanently on either the EEE itself (if not packed) or on the packaging so it can be read without unpacking the equipment.

(b) 
The record shall contain the following information:

— 
name of item (name of the equipment if listed in Annex II or Annex IV, as appropriate, and category set out in Annex I or Annex III, as appropriate),
— 
identification number of the item (type No) where applicable,

DIRECTIVE 2012/19/EU OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL

of 4 July 2012

on waste electrical and electronic equipment (WEEE)

(recast)

(Text with EEA relevance)

THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,

Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, and in particular Article 192(1) thereof,

Having regard to the proposal from the European Commission,

Having regard to the opinion of the European Economic and Social Committee (1),

Having regard to the opinion of the Committee of the Regions (2),

Acting in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure (3),

Whereas:

(1)

A number of substantial changes are to be made to Directive 2002/96/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 27 January 2003 on waste electrical and electronic equipment (WEEE) (4). In the interests of clarity, that Directive should be recast.

(2)

The objectives of the Union’s environment policy are, in particular, to preserve, protect and improve the quality of the environment, to protect human health and to utilise natural resources prudently and rationally. That policy is based on the precautionary principle and the principles that preventive action should be taken, that environmental damage should, as a priority, be rectified at source and that the polluter should pay.

(3)

The Community programme of policy and action in relation to the environment and sustainable development (Fifth Environmental Action Programme) (5) stated that the achievement of sustainable development calls for significant changes in current patterns of development, production, consumption and behaviour and advocates, inter alia, the reduction of wasteful consumption of natural resources and the prevention of pollution. It mentioned waste electrical and electronic equipment (WEEE) as one of the target areas to be regulated, in view of the application of the principles of prevention, recovery and safe disposal of waste.

(4)

This Directive supplements the general waste management legislation of the Union, such as Directive 2008/98/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 19 November 2008 on waste (6). It refers to the definitions in that Directive, including the definitions of waste and general waste management operations. The definition of collection in Directive 2008/98/EC includes the preliminary sorting and preliminary storage of waste for the purposes of transport to a waste treatment facility. Directive 2009/125/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council (7) establishes a framework for setting ecodesign requirements for energy-related products and enables the adoption of specific ecodesign requirements for energy-related products which may also be covered by this Directive. Directive 2009/125/EC and the implementing measures adopted pursuant thereto are without prejudice to the waste management legislation of the Union. Directive 2002/95/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 27 January 2003 on the restriction of the use of certain hazardous substances in electrical and electronic equipment (8) requires the substitution of banned substances in respect of all electrical and electronic equipment (EEE) within its scope.

(5)

As the market continues to expand and innovation cycles become even shorter, the replacement of equipment accelerates, making EEE a fast-growing source of waste. While Directive 2002/95/EC has contributed effectively to reducing hazardous substances contained in new EEE, hazardous substances such as mercury, cadmium, lead, hexavalent chromium and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and ozone-depleting substances will still be present in WEEE for many years. The content of hazardous components in EEE is a major concern during the waste management phase, and recycling of WEEE is not undertaken to a sufficient extent. A lack of recycling results in the loss of valuable resources.

(6)

The purpose of this Directive is to contribute to sustainable production and consumption by, as a first priority, the prevention of WEEE and, in addition, by the re-use, recycling and other forms of recovery of such wastes so as to reduce the disposal of waste and to contribute to the efficient use of resources and the retrieval of valuable secondary raw materials. It also seeks to improve the environmental performance of all operators involved in the life cycle of EEE, e.g. producers, distributors and consumers and, in particular, those operators directly involved in the collection and treatment of WEEE. In particular, different national applications of the ‘producer responsibility’ principle may lead to substantial disparities in the financial burden on economic operators. Having different national policies on the management of WEEE hampers the effectiveness of recycling policies. For that reason, the essential criteria should be laid down at the level of the Union and minimum standards for the treatment of WEEE should be developed.

(7)

The provisions of this Directive should apply to products and producers irrespective of selling technique, including distance and electronic selling. In this connection, the obligations of producers and distributors using distance and electronic selling channels should, as far as is practicable, take the same form, and should be enforced in the same way, as for other distribution channels, in order to avoid those other distribution channels having to bear the costs resulting from this Directive arising from WEEE for which the equipment was sold by distance or electronic selling.

(8)

In order to fulfil the obligations pursuant to this Directive in a given Member State, a producer should be established in that Member State. By exception, to reduce existing barriers to the proper functioning of the internal market and administrative burdens, Member States should allow producers that are not established on their territory, but that are established in another Member State, to appoint an authorised representative to be responsible for fulfilling the obligations of that producer under this Directive. In addition, administrative burdens should be reduced by simplifying registration and reporting procedures and by ensuring that duplicate charges are not levied for registrations within individual Member States.

(9)

This Directive should cover all EEE used by consumers and EEE intended for professional use. This Directive should apply without prejudice to Union legislation on safety and health requirements protecting all actors in contact with WEEE, as well as specific Union waste management legislation, in particular Directive 2006/66/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 6 September 2006 on batteries and accumulators and waste batteries and accumulators (9), and Union product design legislation, in particular Directive 2009/125/EC. The preparing for re-use, recovery and recycling of waste cooling equipment and the substances, mixtures or components thereof should be in accordance with the relevant legislation of the Union, in particular Regulation (EC) No 1005/2009 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 16 September 2009 on substances that deplete the ozone layer (10) and Regulation (EC) No 842/2006 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 17 May 2006 on certain fluorinated greenhouse gases (11). The objectives of this Directive can be achieved without including large-scale fixed installations such as oil platforms, airport luggage transport systems or elevators within its scope. However, any equipment which is not specifically designed and installed as part of those installations, and which can fulfil its function even if it is not part of those installations, should be included in the scope of this Directive. This refers for instance to equipment such as lighting equipment or photovoltaic panels.

(10)

A number of definitions should be included in this Directive in order to specify its scope. However, in the framework of a revision of the scope, the definition of EEE should be further clarified in order to bring Member States’ relevant national measures and current, applied and established practices closer together.

(11)

Ecodesign requirements facilitating the re-use, dismantling and recovery of WEEE should be laid down in the framework of measures implementing Directive 2009/125/EC. In order to optimise re-use and recovery through product design, the whole life cycle of the product should be taken into account.

(12)

The establishment, by this Directive, of producer responsibility is one of the means of encouraging design and production of EEE which take into full account and facilitate its repair, possible upgrading, re-use, disassembly and recycling.

(13)

In order to guarantee the safety and health of distributors’ personnel involved in the take-back and handling of WEEE, Member States should, in accordance with national and Union legislation on safety and health requirements, determine the conditions under which take-back may be refused by distributors.

(14)

Separate collection is a precondition for ensuring specific treatment and recycling of WEEE and is necessary to achieve the chosen level of protection of human health and the environment in the Union. Consumers have to actively contribute to the success of such collection and should be encouraged to return WEEE. For this purpose, convenient facilities should be set up for the return of WEEE, including public collection points, where private households should be able to return their waste at least free of charge. Distributors have an important role in contributing to the success of WEEE collection. Therefore, collection points set up at retail shops for very small WEEE should not be subject to the registration or permit requirements of Directive 2008/98/EC.

(15)

In order to attain the chosen level of protection and the harmonised environmental objectives of the Union, Member States should adopt appropriate measures to minimise the disposal of WEEE as unsorted municipal waste and to achieve a high level of separate collection of WEEE. In order to ensure that Member States strive to set up efficient collection schemes, they should be required to achieve a high level of collection of WEEE, particularly for cooling and freezing equipment containing ozone-depleting substances and fluorinated greenhouse gases, given their high environmental impact and in view of the obligations contained in Regulation (EC) No 842/2006 and Regulation (EC) No 1005/2009. Data included in the impact assessment carried out by the Commission in 2008 show that 65 % of the EEE placed on the market was already separately collected then, but more than half of this was potentially the object of improper treatment and illegal exports, and, even when properly treated, this was not reported. This leads to losses of valuable secondary raw materials, environmental degradation, and provision of inconsistent data. To avoid this, it is necessary to set an ambitious collection target and to ensure that WEEE collected is treated in an environmentally sound way and is correctly reported. It is appropriate to lay down minimum requirements for shipments of used EEE suspected to be WEEE, in the application of which Member States may have regard to any relevant Correspondents’ Guidelines elaborated in the context of the implementation of Regulation (EC) No 1013/2006 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 14 June 2006 on shipments of waste (12). Such minimum requirements should in any case have the purpose of avoiding unwanted shipments of non-functional EEE to developing countries.

(16)

The setting of ambitious collection targets should be based on the amount of WEEE generated where due account is taken of the differing life cycles of products in the Member States, of non-saturated markets and of EEE with a long life cycle. Therefore, a methodology for calculating collection rates based on WEEE generated should be developed in the near future. According to current estimates, a collection rate of 85 % of WEEE generated is broadly equivalent to a collection rate of 65 % of the average weight of EEE placed on the market in the three preceding years.

(17)

Specific treatment for WEEE is indispensable in order to avoid the dispersion of pollutants in recycled material or the waste stream. Such treatment is the most effective means of ensuring compliance with the chosen level of protection of the environment of the Union. Any establishment or undertaking carrying out collection, recycling and treatment operations should comply with minimum standards to prevent negative environmental impacts associated with the treatment of WEEE. The best available treatment, recovery and recycling techniques should be used, provided that they ensure human health and a high level of environmental protection. Best available treatment, recovery and recycling techniques may be further defined in accordance with the procedures of Directive 2008/1/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 15 January 2008 concerning integrated pollution prevention and control (13).

(18)

The Scientific Committee on Emerging and Newly Identified Health Risks, in its opinion on ‘Risk Assessment of Products of Nanotechnology’ of 19 January 2009, stated that exposure to nanomaterials that are firmly embedded in large structures, for example in electronic circuits, may occur in the waste phase and during recycling. To control possible risks to human health and the environment from the treatment of WEEE that contains nanomaterials, it is appropriate for the Commission to assess whether specific treatment may be necessary.

(19)

The collection, storage, transport, treatment and recycling of WEEE as well as its preparation for re-use shall be conducted with an approach geared to protecting the environment and human health and preserving raw materials and shall aim at recycling valuable resources contained in EEE with a view to ensuring a better supply of commodities within the Union.

(20)

Where appropriate, priority should be given to preparing for re-use of WEEE and its components, sub-assemblies and consumables. Where this is not preferable, all WEEE collected separately should be sent for recovery, in the course of which a high level of recycling and recovery should be achieved. In addition, producers should be encouraged to integrate recycled material in new equipment.

(21)

The recovery, preparation for re-use and recycling of WEEE should be counted towards the achievement of the targets laid down in this Directive only if that recovery, preparation for re-use or recycling does not conflict with other Union or national legislation applicable to the equipment. Ensuring proper preparation for re-use, recycling and recovery of WEEE is important for sound resource management and will optimise supply of resources.

(22)

Basic principles with regard to the financing of WEEE management have to be set at the level of the Union, and financing schemes have to contribute to high collection rates, as well as to the implementation of the principle of producer responsibility.

(23)

Users of EEE from private households should have the possibility of returning WEEE at least free of charge. Producers should finance at least the collection from collection facilities, and the treatment, recovery and disposal of WEEE. Member States should encourage producers to take full responsibility for the WEEE collection, in particular by financing the collection of WEEE throughout the entire waste chain, including from private households, in order to avoid separately collected WEEE becoming the object of suboptimal treatment and illegal exports, to create a level playing field by harmonising producer financing across the Union and to shift payment for the collection of this waste from general tax payers to the consumers of EEE, in line with the ‘polluter pays’ principle. In order to give maximum effect to the concept of producer responsibility, each producer should be responsible for financing the management of the waste from his own products. The producer should be able to choose to fulfil this obligation either individually or by joining a collective scheme. Each producer should, when placing a product on the market, provide a financial guarantee to prevent costs for the management of WEEE from orphan products from falling on society or the remaining producers. The responsibility for the financing of the management of historical waste should be shared by all existing producers through collective financing schemes to which all producers that exist on the market when the costs occur contribute proportionately. Collective financing schemes should not have the effect of excluding niche and low-volume producers, importers and new entrants. Collective schemes could provide for differentiated fees based on how easily products and the valuable secondary raw materials that they contain could be recycled. In the case of products which have a long life cycle and which are now covered by this Directive, such as photovoltaic panels, the best possible use should be made of existing collection and recovery systems, provided that they meet the requirements laid down in this Directive.

(24)

Producers could be allowed to show purchasers, on a voluntary basis at the time of sale of new products, the costs of collecting, treating and disposing of WEEE in an environmentally sound way. This is in line with the Commission Communication on Sustainable Consumption and Production and Sustainable Industrial Policy Action Plan, in particular with regard to smarter consumption and green public procurement.

(25)

Information to users about the requirement not to dispose of WEEE as unsorted municipal waste and to collect WEEE separately and about the collection systems and their role in the management of WEEE is indispensable for the success of WEEE collection. Such information necessitates the proper marking of EEE which could end up in rubbish bins or similar means of municipal waste collection.

(26)

Information on component and material identification to be provided by producers is important to facilitate the management, and in particular the treatment and recovery or recycling, of WEEE.

(27)

Member States should ensure that inspection and monitoring infrastructure enables the proper implementation of this Directive to be verified, having regard, inter alia, to Recommendation 2001/331/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 4 April 2001 providing for minimum criteria for environmental inspections in the Member States (14).

(28)

Member States should provide for effective, proportionate and dissuasive penalties to be imposed on natural and legal persons responsible for waste management, where they infringe the provisions of this Directive. Member States should also be able to take action to recover the costs of non-compliance and remedial measures, without prejudice to Directive 2004/35/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 21 April 2004 on environmental liability with regard to the prevention and remedying of environmental damage (15).

(29)

Information about the weight of EEE placed on the market in the Union and the rates of collection, preparation for re-use, including as far as possible preparation for re-use of whole appliances, recovery or recycling and export of WEEE collected in accordance with this Directive is necessary to monitor the achievement of the objectives of this Directive. For the purposes of calculating collection rates, a common methodology for the calculation of weight of EEE should be developed to ascertain, inter alia, whether this term includes the actual weight of the entire equipment in the form in which it is marketed, including all components, sub-assemblies, accessories and consumables but excluding packaging, batteries, instructions for use and manuals.

(30)

It is appropriate to allow Member States to choose to implement certain provisions of this Directive by means of agreements between the competent authorities and the economic sectors concerned, provided that particular requirements are met.

(31)

In order to address difficulties faced by Member States in achieving the collection rates, to take into account technical and scientific progress and to supplement the provisions on fulfilment of recovery targets, the power to adopt acts in accordance with Article 290 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU) should be delegated to the Commission in respect of transitional adjustments for certain Member States, adaptation to technical and scientific progress and the adoption of detailed rules on WEEE exported out of the Union counting towards the fulfilment of recovery targets. It is of particular importance that the Commission carry out appropriate consultations during its preparatory work, including at expert level. The Commission, when preparing and drawing up delegated acts, should ensure a simultaneous, timely and appropriate transmission of relevant documents to the European Parliament and to the Council.

(32)

In order to ensure uniform conditions for the implementation of this Directive, implementing powers should be conferred on the Commission. Those powers should be exercised in accordance with Regulation (EU) No 182/2011 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 16 February 2011 laying down the rules and general principles concerning mechanisms for control by Member States of the Commission’s exercise of implementing powers (16).

(33)

The obligation to transpose this Directive into national law should be confined to those provisions which represent a substantive change as compared with the earlier Directives. The obligation to transpose the provisions which are unchanged arises under the earlier Directives.

(34)

In accordance with the Joint Political Declaration of 28 September 2011 of Member States and the Commission on explanatory documents (17), Member States have undertaken to accompany, in justified cases, the notification of their transposition measures with one or more documents explaining the relationship between the components of a directive and the corresponding parts of national transposition instruments. With regard to this Directive, the legislator considers the transmission of such documents to be justified.

(35)

This Directive should be without prejudice to the obligations of the Member States relating to the time limits for transposition into national law and application of the Directives set out in Annex XI, Part B.

(36)

Since the objective of this Directive cannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member States and can therefore, by reason of the scale of the problem, be better achieved at the level of the Union, the Union may adopt measures, in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity as set out in Article 5 of the Treaty on European Union. In accordance with the principle of proportionality, as set out in that Article, this Directive does not go beyond what is necessary in order to achieve that objective,

HAVE ADOPTED THIS DIRECTIVE:

Article 4

Product design

Member States shall, without prejudice to the requirements of Union legislation on the proper functioning of the internal market and on product design, including Directive 2009/125/EC, encourage cooperation between producers and recyclers and measures to promote the design and production of EEE, notably in view of facilitating re-use, dismantling and recovery of WEEE, its components and materials. In this context, Member States shall take appropriate measures so that the ecodesign requirements facilitating re-use and treatment of WEEE established in the framework of Directive 2009/125/EC are applied and producers do not prevent, through specific design features or manufacturing processes, WEEE from being re-used, unless such specific design features or manufacturing processes present overriding advantages, for example, with regard to the protection of the environment and/or safety requirements.

Article 5

Separate collection

1.   Member States shall adopt appropriate measures to minimise the disposal of WEEE in the form of unsorted municipal waste, to ensure the correct treatment of all collected WEEE and to achieve a high level of separate collection of WEEE, notably, and as a matter of priority, for temperature exchange equipment containing ozone-depleting substances and fluorinated greenhouse gases, fluorescent lamps containing mercury, photovoltaic panels and small equipment as referred to in categories 5 and 6 of Annex III.

2.   For WEEE from private households, Member States shall ensure that:

(a)

systems are set up allowing final holders and distributors to return such waste at least free of charge. Member States shall ensure the availability and accessibility of the necessary collection facilities, taking into account, in particular, the population density;

(b)

when supplying a new product, distributors are responsible for ensuring that such waste can be returned to the distributor at least free of charge on a one-to-one basis as long as the equipment is of equivalent type and has fulfilled the same functions as the supplied equipment. Member States may derogate from this provision provided that they ensure that returning the WEEE is not thereby made more difficult for the final holder and that it remains free of charge for the final holder. Member States making use of this derogation shall inform the Commission thereof;

(c)

distributors provide for the collection, at retail shops with sales areas relating to EEE of at least 400 m2, or in their immediate proximity, of very small WEEE (no external dimension more than 25 cm) free of charge to end-users and with no obligation to buy EEE of an equivalent type, unless an assessment shows that alternative existing collection schemes are likely to be at least as effective. Such assessments shall be available to the public. WEEE collected shall be properly treated in accordance with Article 8;

(d)

without prejudice to points (a), (b) and (c), producers are allowed to set up and to operate individual and/or collective take-back systems for WEEE from private households provided that these are in line with the objectives of this Directive;

(e)

having regard to national and Union health and safety standards, WEEE that presents a health and safety risk to personnel because of contamination may be refused for return under points (a), (b) and (c). Member States shall make specific arrangements for such WEEE.

Member States may provide for specific arrangements for the return of WEEE pursuant to points (a), (b) and (c) for cases in which the equipment does not contain its essential components or if the equipment contains waste other than WEEE.

3.   Member States may designate the operators that are allowed to collect WEEE from private households as referred to in paragraph 2.

4.   Member States may require that the WEEE deposited at collection facilities referred to in paragraphs 2 and 3 is handed over to producers or third parties acting on their behalf or is handed over, for purposes of preparing for re-use, to designated establishments or undertakings.

5.   In the case of WEEE other than WEEE from private households, and without prejudice to Article 13, Member States shall ensure that producers or third parties acting on their behalf provide for the collection of such waste.

Article 6

Disposal and transport of collected WEEE

1.   Member States shall prohibit the disposal of separately collected WEEE which has not yet undergone the treatment specified in Article 8.

2.   Member States shall ensure that the collection and transport of separately collected WEEE is carried out in a way which allows optimal conditions for preparing for re-use, recycling and the confinement of hazardous substances.

In order to maximise preparing for re-use, Member States shall promote that, prior to any further transfer, collection schemes or facilities provide, where appropriate, for the separation at the collection points of WEEE that is to be prepared for re-use from other separately collected WEEE, in particular by granting access for personnel from re-use centres.

Article 7

Collection rate

1.   Without prejudice to Article 5(1), each Member State shall ensure the implementation of the ‘producer responsibility’ principle and, on that basis, that a minimum collection rate is achieved annually. From 2016, the minimum collection rate shall be 45 % calculated on the basis of the total weight of WEEE collected in accordance with Articles 5 and 6 in a given year in the Member State concerned, expressed as a percentage of the average weight of EEE placed on the market in the three preceding years in that Member State. Member States shall ensure that the volume of WEEE collected evolves gradually during the period from 2016 to 2019, unless the collection rate laid down in the second subparagraph has already been achieved.

From 2019, the minimum collection rate to be achieved annually shall be 65 % of the average weight of EEE placed on the market in the three preceding years in the Member State concerned, or alternatively 85 % of WEEE generated on the territory of that Member State.

Until 31 December 2015, a rate of separate collection of at least 4 kilograms on average per inhabitant per year of WEEE from private households or the same amount of weight of WEEE as was collected in that Member State on average in the three preceding years, whichever is greater, shall continue to apply.

Member States may set more ambitious rates for separate collection of WEEE and shall in such a case report this to the Commission.

2.   In order to establish whether the minimum collection rate has been achieved, Member States shall ensure that information concerning the WEEE that is separately collected in accordance with Article 5 is transmitted to the Member States free of charge, including at least information on WEEE that has been:

(a)

received by collection and treatment facilities;

(b)

received by distributors;

(c)

separately collected by producers or third parties acting on their behalf.

3.   By way of derogation from paragraph 1, Bulgaria, the Czech Republic, Latvia, Lithuania, Hungary, Malta, Poland, Romania, Slovenia and Slovakia may, because of their lack of the necessary infrastructure and their low level of EEE consumption, decide to:

(a)

achieve, from 14 August 2016, a collection rate that is lower than 45 % but higher than 40 % of the average weight of EEE placed on the market in the three preceding years; and

(b)

postpone the achievement of the collection rate referred to in the second subparagraph of paragraph 1 until a date of their own choice which shall not be later than 14 August 2021.

4.   The Commission shall be empowered to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 20 laying down the necessary transitional adjustments in order to address difficulties faced by Member States in adhering to the requirements laid down in paragraph 1.

5.   In order to ensure uniform conditions for the implementation of this Article, the Commission shall, by 14 August 2015, adopt implementing acts establishing a common methodology for the calculation of the weight of EEE placed on the national market and a common methodology for the calculation of the quantity of WEEE generated by weight in each Member State. Those implementing acts shall be adopted in accordance with the examination procedure referred to in Article 21(2).

6.   The Commission shall, by 14 August 2015, present a report to the European Parliament and to the Council on the re-examination of the deadlines relating to the collection rates referred to in paragraph 1 and on possibly setting individual collection rates for one or more categories set out in Annex III, particularly for temperature exchange equipment, photovoltaic panels, small equipment, small IT and telecommunication equipment and lamps containing mercury. The report shall, if appropriate, be accompanied by a legislative proposal.

7.   If the Commission considers, on the basis of an impact study, that the collection rate based on WEEE generated requires revision, it shall submit a legislative proposal to the European Parliament and the Council.

Article 8

Proper treatment

1.   Member States shall ensure that all separately collected WEEE undergoes proper treatment.

2.   Proper treatment, other than preparing for re-use, and recovery or recycling operations shall, as a minimum, include the removal of all fluids and a selective treatment in accordance with Annex VII.

3.   Member States shall ensure that producers or third parties acting on their behalf set up systems to provide for the recovery of WEEE using best available techniques. The systems may be set up by producers individually or collectively. Member States shall ensure that any establishment or undertaking carrying out collection or treatment operations stores and treats WEEE in compliance with the technical requirements set out in Annex VIII.

4.   The Commission shall be empowered to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 20 concerning the amendment of Annex VII in order to introduce other treatment technologies that ensure at least the same level of protection for human health and the environment.

The Commission shall evaluate, as a matter of priority, whether the entries regarding printed circuit boards for mobile phones and liquid crystal displays need to be amended. The Commission is invited to evaluate whether amendments to Annex VII are necessary to address nanomaterials contained in EEE.

5.   For the purposes of environmental protection, Member States may set up minimum quality standards for the treatment of the WEEE that has been collected.

Member States which opt for such quality standards shall inform the Commission thereof, which shall publish these standards.

The Commission shall, not later than 14 February 2013, request the European standardisation organisations to develop European standards for the treatment, including recovery, recycling and preparing for re-use, of WEEE. Those standards shall reflect the state of the art.

In order to ensure uniform conditions for the implementation of this Article, the Commission may adopt implementing acts laying down minimum quality standards based in particular on the standards developed by the European standardisation organisations. Those implementing acts shall be adopted in accordance with the examination procedure referred to in Article 21(2).

A reference to the standards adopted by the Commission shall be published.

6.   Member States shall encourage establishments or undertakings which carry out treatment operations to introduce certified environmental management systems in accordance with Regulation (EC) No 1221/2009 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 25 November 2009 on the voluntary participation by organisations in a Community eco-management and audit scheme (EMAS) (23).

Article 9

Permits

1.   Member States shall ensure that any establishment or undertaking carrying out treatment operations obtains a permit from the competent authorities in compliance with Article 23 of Directive 2008/98/EC.

2.   Exemptions from permit requirements, conditions for exemptions and registration shall be in compliance, respectively, with Articles 24, 25 and 26 of Directive 2008/98/EC.

3.   Member States shall ensure that the permit or the registration referred to in paragraphs 1 and 2 includes all the conditions that are necessary for compliance with the requirements of Article 8(2), (3) and (5) and for the achievement of the recovery targets set out in Article 11.

Article 10

Shipments of WEEE

1.   The treatment operation may also be undertaken outside the respective Member State or the Union provided that the shipment of WEEE is in compliance with Regulation (EC) No 1013/2006 and Commission Regulation (EC) No 1418/2007 of 29 November 2007 concerning the export for recovery of certain waste listed in Annex III or IIIA to Regulation (EC) No 1013/2006 of the European Parliament and of the Council to certain countries to which the OECD Decision on the control of transboundary movements of wastes does not apply (24).

2.   WEEE exported out of the Union shall only count towards the fulfilment of obligations and targets set out in Article 11 of this Directive if, in compliance with Regulations (EC) No 1013/2006 and (EC) No 1418/2007, the exporter can prove that the treatment took place in conditions that are equivalent to the requirements of this Directive.

3.   The Commission shall, not later than 14 February 2014, adopt delegated acts, in accordance with Article 20, laying down detailed rules supplementing those in paragraph 2 of this Article, in particular the criteria for the assessment of equivalent conditions.

Article 11

Recovery targets

1.   Regarding all WEEE separately collected in accordance with Article 5 and sent for treatment in accordance with Articles 8, 9 and 10, Member States shall ensure that producers meet the minimum targets set out in Annex V.

2.   The achievement of the targets shall be calculated, for each category, by dividing the weight of the WEEE that enters the recovery or recycling/preparing for re-use facility, after proper treatment in accordance with Article 8(2) with regard to recovery or recycling, by the weight of all separately collected WEEE for each category, expressed as a percentage.

Preliminary activities including sorting and storage prior to recovery shall not count towards the achievement of these targets.

3.   In order to ensure uniform conditions for the implementation of this Article, the Commission may adopt implementing acts establishing additional rules on the calculation methods for the application of the minimum targets. Those implementing acts shall be adopted in accordance with the examination procedure referred to in Article 21(2).

4.   Member States shall ensure that, for the purpose of calculating these targets, producers or third parties acting on their behalf keep records on the weight of WEEE, its components, materials or substances when leaving (output) the collection facility, entering (input) and leaving (output) the treatment facilities and when entering (input) the recovery or recycling/preparing for re-use facility.

Member States shall also ensure that, for the purposes of paragraph 6, records on the weight of products and materials when leaving (output) the recovery or recycling/preparing for re-use facility are kept.

5.   Member States shall encourage the development of new recovery, recycling and treatment technologies.

6.   On the basis of a report of the Commission accompanied, if appropriate, by a legislative proposal, the European Parliament and the Council shall, by 14 August 2016, re-examine the recovery targets referred to in Annex V, Part 3, examine the possibility of setting separate targets for WEEE to be prepared for re-use and re-examine the calculation method referred to in paragraph 2 with a view to analysing the feasibility of setting targets on the basis of products and materials resulting (output) from the recovery, recycling and preparation for re-use processes.

Article 12

Financing in respect of WEEE from private households

1.   Member States shall ensure that producers provide at least for the financing of the collection, treatment, recovery and environmentally sound disposal of WEEE from private households that has been deposited at collection facilities set up under Article 5(2).

2.   Member States may, where appropriate, encourage producers to finance also the costs occurring for collection of WEEE from private households to collection facilities.

3.   For products placed on the market later than 13 August 2005, each producer shall be responsible for financing the operations referred to in paragraph 1 relating to the waste from his own products. The producer may choose to fulfil this obligation either individually or by joining a collective scheme.

Member States shall ensure that each producer provides a guarantee when placing a product on the market showing that the management of all WEEE will be financed and shall ensure that producers clearly mark their products in accordance with Article 15(2). This guarantee shall ensure that the operations referred to in paragraph 1 relating to this product will be financed. The guarantee may take the form of participation by the producer in appropriate schemes for the financing of the management of WEEE, a recycling insurance or a blocked bank account.

4.   The responsibility for the financing of the costs of the management of WEEE from products placed on the market on or before 13 August 2005 (‘historical waste’) shall be borne by one or more systems to which all producers existing on the market when the respective costs occur contribute proportionately, e.g. in proportion to their respective share of the market by type of equipment.

5.   Member States shall take the necessary measures to ensure that appropriate mechanisms or refund procedures are developed for the reimbursement of contributions to the producers where EEE is transferred for placing on the market outside the territory of the Member State concerned. Such mechanisms or procedures may be developed by producers or third parties acting on their behalf.

6.   The Commission is invited to report, by 14 August 2015, on the possibility of developing criteria to incorporate the real end-of-life costs into the financing of WEEE by producers, and to submit a legislative proposal to the European Parliament and the Council if appropriate.

Article 13

Financing in respect of WEEE from users other than private households

1.   Member States shall ensure that the financing of the costs for the collection, treatment, recovery and environmentally sound disposal of WEEE from users other than private households resulting from products placed on the market after 13 August 2005 is to be provided for by producers.

For historical waste being replaced by new equivalent products or by new products fulfilling the same function, the financing of the costs shall be provided for by producers of those products when supplying them. Member States may, as an alternative, provide that users other than private households also be made, partly or totally, responsible for this financing.

For other historical waste, the financing of the costs shall be provided for by the users other than private households.

2.   Producers and users other than private households may, without prejudice to this Directive, conclude agreements stipulating other financing methods.

Article 14

Information for users

1.   Member States may require producers to show purchasers, at the time of sale of new products, the costs of collection, treatment and disposal in an environmentally sound way. The costs mentioned shall not exceed the best estimate of the actual costs incurred.

2.   Member States shall ensure that users of EEE in private households are given the necessary information about:

(a)

the requirement not to dispose of WEEE as unsorted municipal waste and to collect such WEEE separately;

(b)

the return and collection systems available to them, encouraging the coordination of information on the available collection points irrespective of the producers or other operators which have set them up;

(c)

their role in contributing to re-use, recycling and other forms of recovery of WEEE;

(d)

the potential effects on the environment and human health as a result of the presence of hazardous substances in EEE;

(e)

the meaning of the symbol shown in Annex IX.

3.   Member States shall adopt appropriate measures so that consumers participate in the collection of WEEE and to encourage them to facilitate the process of re-use, treatment and recovery.

4.   With a view to minimising the disposal of WEEE as unsorted municipal waste and to facilitating its separate collection, Member States shall ensure that producers appropriately mark — preferably in accordance with the European standard EN 50419 (25) — EEE placed on the market with the symbol shown in Annex IX. In exceptional cases, where this is necessary because of the size or the function of the product, the symbol shall be printed on the packaging, on the instructions for use and on the warranty of the EEE.

5.   Member States may require that some or all of the information referred to in paragraphs 2, 3 and 4 shall be provided by producers and/or distributors, e.g. in the instructions for use, at the point of sale and through public awareness campaigns.

Article 15

evidence of evaluation or testing in the form of a copy of the records (certificate of testing, proof of functionality) on every item within the consignment and a protocol containing all record information according to point 3;

(c)

a declaration made by the holder who arranges the transport of the EEE that none of the material or equipment within the consignment is waste as defined by Article 3(1) of Directive 2008/98/EC; and

(d)

appropriate protection against damage during transportation, loading and unloading in particular through sufficient packaging and appropriate stacking of the load.

2.

By way of derogation, point 1(a) and (b) and point 3 do not apply where it is documented by conclusive proof that the shipment is taking place in the framework of a business-to-business transfer agreement and that:
(a)

the EEE is sent back to the producer or a third party acting on his behalf as defective for repair under warranty with the intention of re-use; or

(b)

the used EEE for professional use is sent to the producer or a third party acting on his behalf or a third-party facility in countries to which Decision C(2001)107/Final of the OECD Council concerning the revision of Decision C(92)39/Final on control of transboundary movements of wastes destined for recovery operations applies, for refurbishment or repair under a valid contract with the intention of re-use; or

(c)

the defective used EEE for professional use, such as medical devices or their parts, is sent to the producer or a third party acting on his behalf for root cause analysis under a valid contract, in cases where such an analysis can only be conducted by the producer or third parties acting on his behalf.

3.

In order to demonstrate that the items being shipped constitute used EEE rather than WEEE, Member States shall require the following steps for testing and record keeping for used EEE to be carried out:
 

Step 1: Testing

(a)

Functionality shall be tested and the presence of hazardous substances shall be evaluated. The tests to be conducted depend on the kind of EEE. For most of the used EEE a functionality test of the key functions is sufficient.

(b)

Results of evaluation and testing shall be recorded.

 

Step 2: Record

(a)

The record shall be fixed securely but not permanently on either the EEE itself (if not packed) or on the packaging so it can be read without unpacking the equipment.

(b)

The record shall contain the following information:

—

name of item (name of the equipment if listed in Annex II or Annex IV, as appropriate, and category set out in Annex I or Annex III, as appropriate),

—

identification number of the item (type No) where applicable,

—

year of production (if available),

—

name and address of the company responsible for evidence of functionality,

—

result of tests as described in step 1 (including date of the functionality test),

This may require specific waste streams departing from the hierarchy where this is justified by life-cycle thinking on the overall impacts of the generation and management of such waste.
Member States shall ensure that the development of waste legislation and policy is a fully transparent process, observing existing national rules about the consultation and involvement of citizens and stakeholders.

Member States shall take into account the general environmental protection principles of precaution and sustainability, technical feasibility and economic viability, protection of resources as well as the overall environmental, human health, economic and social impacts, in accordance with Articles 1 and 13.

▼M4

3.   Member States shall make use of economic instruments and other measures to provide incentives for the application of the waste hierarchy, such as those indicated in Annex IVa or other appropriate instruments and measures.
▼B

Article 5

By-products

▼M4

1.   Member States shall take appropriate measures to ensure that a substance or object resulting from a production process the primary aim of which is not the production of that substance or object is considered not to be waste, but to be a by-product if the following conditions are met:
▼B

(a) 
further use of the substance or object is certain;

(b) 
the substance or object can be used directly without any further processing other than normal industrial practice;

(c) 
the substance or object is produced as an integral part of a production process; and

(d) 
further use is lawful, i.e. the substance or object fulfils all relevant product, environmental and health protection requirements for the specific use and will not lead to overall adverse environmental or human health impacts.

▼M4

2.   The Commission may adopt implementing acts in order to establish detailed criteria on the uniform application of the conditions laid down in paragraph 1 to specific substances or objects.
Those detailed criteria shall ensure a high level of protection of the environment and human health and facilitate the prudent and rational utilisation of natural resources.

Those implementing acts shall be adopted in accordance with the examination procedure referred to in Article 39(2). When adopting those implementing acts, the Commission shall take as a starting point the most stringent and environmentally protective of any criteria adopted by Member States in accordance with paragraph 3 of this Article and shall prioritise replicable practices of industrial symbiosis in the development of the detailed criteria.

▼M4

3.   Where criteria have not been set at Union level under paragraph 2, Member States may establish detailed criteria on the application of the conditions laid down in paragraph 1 to specific substances or objects.
Member States shall notify the Commission of those detailed criteria in accordance with Directive (EU) 2015/1535 of the European Parliament and of the Council ( 4 ) where so required by that Directive.

▼B

Article 6

End-of-waste status

▼M4

1.   Member States shall take appropriate measures to ensure that waste which has undergone a recycling or other recovery operation is considered to have ceased to be waste if it complies with the following conditions:
(a) 
the substance or object is to be used for specific purposes;

▼B

(b) 
a market or demand exists for such a substance or object;

(c) 
the substance or object fulfils the technical requirements for the specific purposes and meets the existing legislation and standards applicable to products; and

(d) 
the use of the substance or object will not lead to overall adverse environmental or human health impacts.

▼M4 —————

▼M4

2.   The Commission shall monitor the development of national end-of-waste criteria in Member States, and assess the need to develop Union-wide criteria on this basis. To that end, and where appropriate, the Commission shall adopt implementing acts in order to establish detailed criteria on the uniform application of the conditions laid down in paragraph 1 to certain types of waste.
Those detailed criteria shall ensure a high level of protection of the environment and human health and facilitate the prudent and rational utilisation of natural resources. They shall include:

(a) 
permissible waste input material for the recovery operation;

(b) 
allowed treatment processes and techniques;

(c) 
quality criteria for end-of-waste materials resulting from the recovery operation in line with the applicable product standards, including limit values for pollutants where necessary;

(d) 
requirements for management systems to demonstrate compliance with the end-of-waste criteria, including for quality control and self-monitoring, and accreditation, where appropriate; and

(e) 
a requirement for a statement of conformity.

Those implementing acts shall be adopted in accordance with the examination procedure referred to in Article 39(2).

When adopting those implementing acts, the Commission shall take account of the relevant criteria established by Member States in accordance with paragraph 3 and shall take as a starting point the most stringent and environmentally protective of those criteria.

3.   Where criteria have not been set at Union level under paragraph 2, Member States may establish detailed criteria on the application of the conditions laid down in paragraph 1 to certain types of waste. Those detailed criteria shall take into account any possible adverse environmental and human health impacts of the substance or object and shall satisfy the requirements laid down in points (a) to (e) of paragraph 2.
Member States shall notify the Commission of those criteria in accordance with Directive (EU) 2015/1535 where so required by that Directive.

4.   Where criteria have not been set at either Union or national level under paragraph 2 or 3, respectively, a Member State may decide on a case-by-case basis, or take appropriate measures to verify, that certain waste has ceased to be waste on the basis of the conditions laid down in paragraph 1 and, where necessary, reflecting the requirements laid down in points (a) to (e) of paragraph 2, and taking into account limit values for pollutants and any possible adverse environmental and human health impacts. Such case-by-case decisions are not required to be notified to the Commission in accordance with Directive (EU) 2015/1535.
Member States may make information about case-by-case decisions and about the results of verification by competent authorities publicly available by electronic means.

▼M4

5.   The natural or legal person who:
(a) 
uses, for the first time, a material that has ceased to be waste and that has not been placed on the market; or

(b) 
places a material on the market for the first time after it has ceased to be waste,

shall ensure that the material meets relevant requirements under the applicable chemical and product related legislation. The conditions laid down in paragraph 1 have to be met before the legislation on chemicals and products applies to the material that has ceased to be waste.

▼B

Article 7

List of waste

►M4   1.   The Commission is empowered to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 38a in order to supplement this Directive by establishing, and reviewing in accordance with paragraphs 2 and 3 of this Article, a list of waste. ◄ The list of waste shall include hazardous waste and shall take into account the origin and composition of the waste and, where necessary, the limit values of concentration of hazardous substances. The list of waste shall be binding as regards determination of the waste which is to be considered as hazardous waste. The inclusion of a substance or object in the list shall not mean that it is waste in all circumstances. A substance or object shall be considered to be waste only where the definition in point (1) of Article 3 is met.
▼M4

2.   A Member State may consider waste as hazardous waste where, even though it does not appear as such on the list of waste, it displays one or more of the properties listed in Annex III. The Member State shall notify the Commission of any such cases without delay and provide the Commission with all relevant information. In the light of notifications received, the list shall be reviewed in order to decide on its adaptation.
▼B

3.   Where a Member State has evidence to show that specific waste that appears on the list as hazardous waste does not display any of the properties listed in Annex III, it may consider that waste as non-hazardous waste. The Member State shall notify the Commission of any such cases without delay and shall provide the Commission with the necessary evidence. In the light of notifications received, the list shall be reviewed in order to decide on its adaptation.
4.   The reclassification of hazardous waste as non-hazardous waste may not be achieved by diluting or mixing the waste with the aim of lowering the initial concentrations of hazardous substances to a level below the thresholds for defining waste as hazardous.
▼M4 —————

▼B

6.   Member States may consider waste as non-hazardous waste in accordance with the list of waste referred to in paragraph 1.
7.   The Commission shall ensure that the list of waste and any review of this list adhere, as appropriate, to principles of clarity, comprehensibility and accessibility for users, particularly small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs).
CHAPTER II

GENERAL REQUIREMENTS

Article 8

Extended producer responsibility

1.   In order to strengthen the re-use and the prevention, recycling and other recovery of waste, Member States may take legislative or non-legislative measures to ensure that any natural or legal person who professionally develops, manufactures, processes, treats, sells or imports products (producer of the product) has extended producer responsibility.
Such measures may include an acceptance of returned products and of the waste that remains after those products have been used, as well as the subsequent management of the waste and financial responsibility for such activities. These measures may include the obligation to provide publicly available information as to the extent to which the product is re-usable and recyclable.

▼M4

Where such measures include the establishment of extended producer responsibility schemes, the general minimum requirements laid down in Article 8a shall apply.

Member States may decide that producers of products that undertake financial or financial and organisational responsibilities for the management of the waste stage of a product’s life cycle of their own accord should apply some or all of the general minimum requirements laid down in Article 8a.

▼M4

2.   Member States may take appropriate measures to encourage the design of products and components of products in order to reduce their environmental impact and the generation of waste in the course of the production and subsequent use of products, and in order to ensure that the recovery and disposal of products that have become waste take place in accordance with Articles 4 and 13.
Such measures may encourage, inter alia, the development, production and marketing of products and components of products that are suitable for multiple use, that contain recycled materials, that are technically durable and easily reparable and that are, after having become waste, suitable for preparing for re-use and recycling in order to facilitate proper implementation of the waste hierarchy. The measures shall take into account the impact of products throughout their life cycle, the waste hierarchy and, where appropriate, the potential for multiple recycling.

▼B

3.   When applying extended producer responsibility, Member States shall take into account the technical feasibility and economic viability and the overall environmental, human health and social impacts, respecting the need to ensure the proper functioning of the internal market.
4.   The extended producer responsibility shall be applied without prejudice to the responsibility for waste management as provided for in Article 15(1) and without prejudice to existing waste stream specific and product specific legislation.
▼M4

5.   The Commission shall organise an exchange of information between Member States and the actors involved in extended producer responsibility schemes on the practical implementation of the general minimum requirements laid down in Article 8a. This includes, inter alia, exchange of information on best practices to ensure adequate governance, cross-border cooperation concerning extended producer responsibility schemes and a smooth functioning of the internal market, on the organisational features and the monitoring of organisations implementing extended producer responsibility obligations on behalf of producers of products, on the modulation of financial contributions, on the selection of waste management operators and on the prevention of littering. The Commission shall publish the results of the exchange of information and may provide guidelines on these and other relevant aspects.
The Commission shall publish guidelines, in consultation with Member States, on cross-border cooperation concerning extended producer responsibility schemes and on the modulation of financial contributions referred to in point (b) of Article 8a(4).

Where necessary to avoid distortion of the internal market, the Commission may adopt implementing acts in order to lay down criteria with a view to the uniform application of point (b) of Article 8a(4), but excluding any precise determination of the level of the contributions. Those implementing acts shall be adopted in accordance with the examination procedure referred to in Article 39(2).

Article 8a

General minimum requirements for extended producer responsibility schemes

1.   Where extended producer responsibility schemes are established in accordance with Article 8(1), including pursuant to other legislative acts of the Union, Member States shall:
(a) 
define in a clear way the roles and responsibilities of all relevant actors involved, including producers of products placing products on the market of the Member State, organisations implementing extended producer responsibility obligations on their behalf, private or public waste operators, local authorities and, where appropriate, re-use and preparing for re-use operators and social economy enterprises;

(b) 
in line with the waste hierarchy, set waste management targets, aiming to attain at least the quantitative targets relevant for the extended producer responsibility scheme as laid down in this Directive, Directive 94/62/EC, Directive 2000/53/EC, Directive 2006/66/EC and Directive 2012/19/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council ( 5 ), and set other quantitative targets and/or qualitative objectives that are considered relevant for the extended producer responsibility scheme;

(c) 
ensure that a reporting system is in place to gather data on the products placed on the market of the Member State by the producers of products subject to extended producer responsibility and data on the collection and treatment of waste resulting from those products specifying, where appropriate, the waste material flows, as well as other data relevant for the purposes of point (b);

(d) 
ensure equal treatment of producers of products regardless of their origin or size, without placing a disproportionate regulatory burden on producers, including small and medium-sized enterprises, of small quantities of products.

2.   Member States shall take the necessary measures to ensure that the waste holders targeted by the extended producer responsibility schemes established in accordance with Article 8(1), are informed about waste prevention measures, centres for re-use and preparing for re-use, take-back and collection systems, and the prevention of littering. Member States shall also take measures to create incentives for the waste holders to assume their responsibility to deliver their waste into the separate collection systems in place, notably, where appropriate, through economic incentives or regulations.
3.   Member States shall take the necessary measures to ensure that any producer of products or organisation implementing extended producer responsibility obligations on behalf of producers of products:
(a) 
has a clearly defined geographical, product and material coverage without limiting those areas to those where the collection and management of waste are the most profitable;

(b) 
provides an appropriate availability of waste collection systems within the areas referred to in point (a);

(c) 
has the necessary financial means or financial and organisational means to meet its extended producer responsibility obligations;

(d) 
puts in place an adequate self-control mechanism, supported, where relevant, by regular independent audits, to appraise:

(i) 
its financial management, including compliance with the requirements laid down in points (a) and (b) of paragraph 4;

(ii) 
the quality of data collected and reported in accordance with point (c) of paragraph 1 of this Article and with the requirements of Regulation (EC) No 1013/2006;

(e) 
makes publicly available information about the attainment of the waste management targets referred to in point (b) of paragraph 1, and, in the case of collective fulfilment of extended producer responsibility obligations, also information about:

(i) 
its ownership and membership;

(ii) 
the financial contributions paid by producers of products per unit sold or per tonne of product placed on the market; and

(iii) 
the selection procedure for waste management operators.

4.   Member States shall take the necessary measures to ensure that the financial contributions paid by the producer of the product to comply with its extended producer responsibility obligations:
(a) 
cover the following costs for the products that the producer puts on the market in the Member State concerned:

— 
costs of separate collection of waste and its subsequent transport and treatment, including treatment necessary to meet the Union waste management targets, and costs necessary to meet other targets and objectives as referred to in point (b) of paragraph 1, taking into account the revenues from re-use, from sales of secondary raw material from its products and from unclaimed deposit fees,
— 
costs of providing adequate information to waste holders in accordance with paragraph 2,
— 
costs of data gathering and reporting in accordance with point (c) of paragraph 1.
This point shall not apply to extended producer responsibility schemes established pursuant to Directive 2000/53/EC, 2006/66/EC or 2012/19/EU;

(b) 
in the case of collective fulfilment of extended producer responsibility obligations, are modulated, where possible, for individual products or groups of similar products, notably by taking into account their durability, reparability, re-usability and recyclability and the presence of hazardous substances, thereby taking a life-cycle approach and aligned with the requirements set by relevant Union law, and where available, based on harmonised criteria in order to ensure a smooth functioning of the internal market; and

(c) 
do not exceed the costs that are necessary to provide waste management services in a cost-efficient way. Such costs shall be established in a transparent way between the actors concerned.

Where justified by the need to ensure proper waste management and the economic viability of the extended producer responsibility scheme, Member States may depart from the division of financial responsibility as laid down in point (a), provided that:

(i) 
in the case of extended producer responsibility schemes established to attain waste management targets and objectives established under legislative acts of the Union, the producers of products bear at least 80 % of the necessary costs;

(ii) 
in the case of extended producer responsibility schemes established on or after 4 July 2018 to attain waste management targets and objectives solely established in Member State legislation, the producers of products bear at least 80 % of the necessary costs;

(iii) 
in the case of extended producer responsibility schemes established before 4 July 2018 to attain waste management targets and objectives solely established in Member State legislation, the producers of products bear at least 50 % of the necessary costs,

and provided that the remaining costs are borne by original waste producers or distributors.

This derogation may not be used to lower the proportion of costs borne by producers of products under extended producer responsibility schemes established before 4 July 2018.

5.   Member States shall establish an adequate monitoring and enforcement framework with a view to ensuring that producers of products and organisations implementing extended producer responsibility obligations on their behalf implement their extended producer responsibility obligations, including in the case of distance sales, that the financial means are properly used and that all actors involved in the implementation of the extended producer responsibility schemes report reliable data.
Where, in the territory of a Member State, multiple organisations implement extended producer responsibility obligations on behalf of producers of products, the Member State concerned shall appoint at least one body independent of private interests or entrust a public authority to oversee the implementation of extended producer responsibility obligations.

Each Member State shall allow the producers of products established in another Member State and placing products on its territory to appoint a legal or natural person established on its territory as an authorised representative for the purposes of fulfilling the obligations of a producer related to extended producer responsibility schemes on its territory.

For the purposes of monitoring and verifying compliance with the obligations of the producer of the product in relation to extended producer responsibility schemes, Member States may lay down requirements, such as registration, information and reporting requirements, to be met by a legal or natural person to be appointed as an authorised representative on their territory.

6.   Member States shall ensure a regular dialogue between relevant stakeholders involved in the implementation of extended producer responsibility schemes, including producers and distributors, private or public waste operators, local authorities, civil society organisations and, where applicable, social economy actors, re-use and repair networks and preparing for re-use operators.
7.   Member States shall take measures to ensure that extended producer responsibility schemes that have been established before 4 July 2018, comply with this Article by 5 January 2023.
8.   The provision of information to the public under this Article shall be without prejudice to preserving the confidentiality of commercially sensitive information in conformity with the relevant Union and national law.
▼M4

Article 10

Recovery

1.   Member States shall take the necessary measures to ensure that waste undergoes preparing for re-use, recycling or other recovery operations, in accordance with Articles 4 and 13.
2.   Where necessary to comply with paragraph 1 and to facilitate or improve preparing for re-use, recycling and other recovery operations, waste shall be subject to separate collection and shall not be mixed with other waste or other materials with different properties.
3.   Member States may allow derogations from paragraph 2 provided that at least one of the following conditions is met:
(a) 
collecting certain types of waste together does not affect their potential to undergo preparing for re-use, recycling or other recovery operations in accordance with Article 4 and results in output from those operations which is of comparable quality to that achieved through separate collection;

(b) 
separate collection does not deliver the best environmental outcome when considering the overall environmental impacts of the management of the relevant waste streams;

(c) 
separate collection is not technically feasible taking into consideration good practices in waste collection;

(d) 
separate collection would entail disproportionate economic costs taking into account the costs of adverse environmental and health impacts of mixed waste collection and treatment, the potential for efficiency improvements in waste collection and treatment, revenues from sales of secondary raw materials as well as the application of the polluter-pays principle and extended producer responsibility.

Member States shall regularly review derogations under this paragraph taking into account good practices in separate collection of waste and other developments in waste management.

4.   Member States shall take measures to ensure that waste that has been separately collected for preparing for re-use and recycling pursuant to Article 11(1) and Article 22 is not incinerated, with the exception of waste resulting from subsequent treatment operations of the separately collected waste for which incineration delivers the best environmental outcome in accordance with Article 4.

The Commission shall assess co-processing technology that allows the incorporation of minerals in the co-incineration process of municipal waste. Where a reliable methodology can be found, as part of this review, the Commission shall consider whether such minerals may be counted towards recycling targets.

Article 11a

Rules on the calculation of the attainment of the targets

1.   For the purpose of calculating whether the targets laid down in points (c), (d) and (e) of Article 11(2) and in Article 11(3) have been attained:
(a) 
Member States shall calculate the weight of the municipal waste generated and prepared for re-use or recycled in a given calendar year;

(b) 
the weight of the municipal waste prepared for re-use shall be calculated as the weight of products or components of products that have become municipal waste and have undergone all necessary checking, cleaning or repairing operations to enable re-use without further sorting or pre-processing;

(c) 
the weight of the municipal waste recycled shall be calculated as the weight of waste which, having undergone all necessary checking, sorting and other preliminary operations to remove waste materials that are not targeted by the subsequent reprocessing and to ensure high-quality recycling, enters the recycling operation whereby waste materials are actually reprocessed into products, materials or substances.

2.   For the purposes of point (c) of paragraph 1, the weight of the municipal waste recycled shall be measured when the waste enters the recycling operation.
By way of derogation from the first subparagraph, the weight of municipal waste recycled may be measured at the output of any sorting operation provided that:

(a) 
such output waste is subsequently recycled;

(b) 
the weight of materials or substances that are removed by further operations preceding the recycling operation and are not subsequently recycled is not included in the weight of waste reported as recycled.

3.   Member States shall establish an effective system of quality control and traceability of municipal waste to ensure that the conditions laid down in point (c) of paragraph 1 of this Article and in paragraph 2 of this Article are met. To ensure the reliability and accuracy of the data gathered on recycled waste, the system may consist of electronic registries set up pursuant to Article 35(4), technical specifications for the quality requirements of sorted waste, or average loss rates for sorted waste for various waste types and waste management practices respectively. Average loss rates shall only be used in cases where reliable data cannot be obtained otherwise and shall be calculated on the basis of the calculation rules established in the delegated act adopted pursuant to paragraph 10 of this Article.
4.   For the purpose of calculating whether the targets laid down in points (c), (d) and (e) of Article 11(2) and in Article 11(3) have been attained, the amount of municipal biodegradable waste that enters aerobic or anaerobic treatment may be counted as recycled where that treatment generates compost, digestate, or other output with a similar quantity of recycled content in relation to input, which is to be used as a recycled product, material or substance. Where the output is used on land, Member States may count it as recycled only if this use results in benefits to agriculture or ecological improvement.
As from 1 January 2027, Member States may count municipal bio-waste entering aerobic or anaerobic treatment as recycled only if, in accordance with Article 22, it has been separately collected or separated at source.

5.   For the purposes of calculating whether the targets laid down in points (c), (d) and (e) of Article 11(2) and in Article 11(3) have been attained, the amount of waste materials that have ceased to be waste as a result of a preparatory operation before being reprocessed may be counted as recycled provided that such materials are destined for subsequent reprocessing into products, materials or substances to be used for the original or other purposes. However, end-of-waste materials to be used as fuels or other means to generate energy, or to be incinerated, backfilled or landfilled, shall not be counted towards the attainment of the recycling targets.
6.   For the purposes of calculating whether the targets laid down in points (c), (d) and (e) of Article 11(2) and in Article 11(3) have been attained, Member States may take into account the recycling of metals separated after incineration of municipal waste provided that the recycled metals meet certain quality criteria laid down in the implementing act adopted pursuant to paragraph 9 of this Article.
7.   Waste sent to another Member State for the purposes of preparing for re-use, recycling or backfilling in that other Member State may only be counted towards the attainment of the targets laid down in Article 11(2) and (3) by the Member State in which that waste was collected.
8.   Waste exported from the Union for preparing for re-use or recycling shall count towards the attainment of the targets laid down in Article 11(2) and (3) of this Directive by the Member State in which it was collected only if the requirements of paragraph 3 of this Article are met and if, in accordance with Regulation (EC) No 1013/2006, the exporter can prove that the shipment of waste complies with the requirements of that Regulation and that the treatment of waste outside the Union took place in conditions that are broadly equivalent to the requirements of the relevant Union environmental law.
9.   In order to ensure uniform conditions for the application of this Article, the Commission shall adopt by 31 March 2019 implementing acts establishing rules for the calculation, verification and reporting of data, in particular as regards:
(a) 
a common methodology for the calculation of the weight of metals that have been recycled in accordance with paragraph 6, including quality criteria for the recycled metals, and

(b) 
bio-waste separated and recycled at source.

Those implementing acts shall be adopted in accordance with the examination procedure referred to in Article 39(2).

10.   By 31 March 2019, the Commission shall adopt a delegated act in accordance with Article 38a in order to supplement this Directive by establishing rules for the calculation, verification and reporting of the weight of materials or substances which are removed after a sorting operation and which are not subsequently recycled, based on average loss rates for sorted waste.
Article 11b

Early warning report

1.   The Commission shall, in cooperation with the European Environment Agency, draw up reports on the progress towards the attainment of the targets laid down in points (c), (d) and (e) of Article 11(2) and in Article 11(3) at the latest three years before each deadline laid down therein.
2.   The reports referred to in paragraph 1 shall include the following:
(a) 
an estimation of the attainment of the targets by each Member State;

(b) 
a list of Member States at risk of not attaining the targets within the respective deadlines, accompanied by appropriate recommendations for the Member States concerned;

(c) 
examples of best practices that are used throughout the Union which could provide guidance for progressing towards attaining the targets.

Member States shall take appropriate measures, in cooperation with other Member States where this is necessary or advisable, to establish an integrated and adequate network of waste disposal installations and of installations for the recovery of mixed municipal waste collected from private households, including where such collection also covers such waste from other producers, taking into account best available techniques.
By way of derogation from Regulation (EC) No 1013/2006, Member States may, in order to protect their network, limit incoming shipments of waste destined to incinerators that are classified as recovery, where it has been established that such shipments would result in national waste having to be disposed of or waste having to be treated in a way that is not consistent with their waste management plans. Member States shall notify the Commission of any such decision. Member States may also limit outgoing shipments of waste on environmental grounds as set out in Regulation (EC) No 1013/2006.

2.   The network shall be designed to enable the Community as a whole to become self-sufficient in waste disposal as well as in the recovery of waste referred to in paragraph 1, and to enable Member States to move towards that aim individually, taking into account geographical circumstances or the need for specialised installations for certain types of waste.
3.   The network shall enable waste to be disposed of or waste referred to in paragraph 1 to be recovered in one of the nearest appropriate installations, by means of the most appropriate methods and technologies, in order to ensure a high level of protection for the environment and public health.
4.   The principles of proximity and self-sufficiency shall not mean that each Member State has to possess the full range of final recovery facilities within that Member State.
Article 17

Control of hazardous waste

Member States shall take the necessary action to ensure that the production, collection and transportation of hazardous waste, as well as its storage and treatment, are carried out in conditions providing protection for the environment and human health in order to meet the provisions of Article 13, including action to ensure traceability from production to final destination and control of hazardous waste in order to meet the requirements of Articles 35 and 36.

— 
0,60 for installations in operation and permitted in accordance with applicable Community legislation before 1 January 2009,
— 
0,65 for installations permitted after 31 December 2008,
using the following formula:

Energy efficiency = (Ep - (Ef + Ei))/(0,97 × (Ew + Ef))

In which:

Ep means annual energy produced as heat or electricity. It is calculated with energy in the form of electricity being multiplied by 2,6 and heat produced for commercial use multiplied by 1,1 (GJ/year)
Ef means annual energy input to the system from fuels contributing to the production of steam (GJ/year)
Ew means annual energy contained in the treated waste calculated using the net calorific value of the waste (GJ/year)
Ei means annual energy imported excluding Ew and Ef (GJ/year)
0,97 is a factor accounting for energy losses due to bottom ash and radiation.
This formula shall be applied in accordance with the reference document on Best Available Techniques for waste incineration.

►M2 

 

The energy efficiency formula value will be multiplied by a climate correction factor (CCF) as shown below:

1. 
CCF for installations in operation and permitted in accordance with applicable Union legislation before 1 September 2015.

CCF = 1 if HDD >= 3 350

CCF = 1,25 if HDD <= 2 150

CCF = – (0,25/1 200 ) × HDD + 1,698 when 2 150 < HDD < 3 350

2. 
CCF for installations permitted after 31 August 2015 and for installations under 1 after 31 December 2029:

CCF = 1 if HDD >= 3 350

CCF = 1,12 if HDD <= 2 150

CCF = – (0,12/1 200 ) × HDD + 1,335 when 2 150 < HDD < 3 350

(The resulting value of CCF will be rounded at three decimal places).

►C1 

 

The value of HDD (Heating Degree Days) should be taken as the average of annual HDD values for the incineration facility location, calculated for a period of 20 consecutive years before the year for which CCF is calculated. For the calculation of the value of HDD the following method established by Eurostat should be applied: HDD is equal to (18 °C – Tm) × d if Tm is lower than or equal to 15 °C (heating threshold) and is nil if Tm is greater than 15 °C; where Tm is the mean (Tmin + Tmax)/2 outdoor temperature over a period of d days. Calculations are to be executed on a daily basis (d = 1), added up to a year.

REGULATION (EU) 2019/1020 OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL

of 20 June 2019

on market surveillance and compliance of products and amending Directive 2004/42/EC and Regulations (EC) No 765/2008 and (EU) No 305/2011

(Text with EEA relevance)

THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,

Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, and in particular Articles 33 and 114 thereof,

Having regard to the proposal from the European Commission,

After transmission of the draft legislative act to the national parliaments,

Having regard to the opinion of the European Economic and Social Committee (1),

Acting in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure (2),

Whereas:

(1)

In order to guarantee the free movement of products within the Union, it is necessary to ensure that products are compliant with Union harmonisation legislation and therefore fulfil requirements providing a high level of protection of public interests, such as health and safety in general, health and safety in the workplace, protection of consumers, protection of the environment, public security and protection of any other public interests protected by that legislation. Robust enforcement of these requirements is essential to the proper protection of these interests and to create the conditions in which fair competition in the Union market for goods can thrive. Rules are therefore necessary to ensure this enforcement, regardless of whether products are placed on the market via offline or online means and regardless of whether they are manufactured in the Union or not.

(2)

Union harmonisation legislation covers a large share of manufactured products. Non-compliant and unsafe products put citizens at risk, and might distort competition with economic operators selling compliant products within the Union.

(3)

Strengthening the single market for goods through further enhancing efforts to keep non-compliant products from being placed on the Union market was identified as a priority in the Communication from the Commission of 28 October 2015 entitled ‘Upgrading the Single Market: more opportunities for people and business’. This should be achieved by strengthening market surveillance, providing economic operators with clear, transparent and comprehensive rules, intensifying compliance controls and promoting closer cross-border cooperation among enforcement authorities, including through cooperation with customs authorities.

(4)

The framework for market surveillance established by this Regulation should complement and strengthen existing provisions in Union harmonisation legislation relating to the ensuring of compliance of products and the framework for cooperation with organisations representing economic operators or end users, the market surveillance of products and controls on those products entering the Union market. However, in accordance with the principle of lex specialis, this Regulation should apply only in so far as there are no specific provisions with the same objective, nature or effect in Union harmonisation legislation. The corresponding provisions of this Regulation should therefore not apply in the areas covered by such specific provisions, for instance those set out in Regulations (EC) No 1223/2009 (3), (EU) 2017/745 (4) and (EU) 2017/746 (5), including as regards the use of the European database on medical devices (EUDAMED), and (EU) 2018/858 (6) of the European Parliament and of the Council.

(5)

Directive 2001/95/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council (7) lays down the general safety requirements for all consumer products and provides for specific obligations and powers of the Member States in relation to dangerous products as well as for the exchange of information to that effect through the Rapid Information Exchange System (RAPEX). Market surveillance authorities should have the possibility of taking the more specific measures available to them under that Directive. In order to achieve a higher level of safety for consumer products, the mechanisms for exchanges of information and rapid intervention situations provided for in Directive 2001/95/EC should be made more effective.

(6)

The provisions on market surveillance of this Regulation should cover products that are subject to the Union harmonisation legislation listed in Annex I concerning manufactured products other than food, feed, medicinal products for human and veterinary use, living plants and animals, products of human origin and products of plants and animals relating directly to their future reproduction. This will ensure a uniform framework for market surveillance of those products at Union level and will help to increase the confidence of consumers and other end users in products placed on the Union market. If new Union harmonisation legislation is adopted in the future, it will be for that legislation to specify whether this Regulation is also to apply to that legislation.

(7)

Articles 15 to 29 of Regulation (EC) No 765/2008 of the European Parliament and of the Council (8) laying down the Community market surveillance framework and controls of products entering the Community market should be deleted and the respective provisions should be replaced by this Regulation. That framework includes the provisions on controls of products entering the Community market, in Articles 27, 28 and 29 of Regulation (EC) No 765/2008, which apply not only to products covered by the market surveillance framework, but to all products in so far as other Union law does not contain specific provisions relating to the organisation of controls on products entering the Union market. It is therefore necessary that the scope of the provisions of this Regulation with regard to products entering the Union market extend to all products.

(8)

In order to rationalise and simplify the overall legislative framework, while simultaneously pursuing the objectives of Better Regulation, the rules applicable to controls on products entering the Union market should be revised and integrated into a single legislative framework for controls on products at the Union's external borders.

(9)

Responsibility for enforcing Union harmonisation legislation should lie with the Member States, and their market surveillance authorities should be required to ensure that the legislation is fully complied with. The Member States should, therefore, establish systematic approaches to ensure effectiveness of market surveillance and other enforcement activities. In this regard, the methodology and criteria for assessing risks should be further harmonised in all Member States in order to ensure a level playing field for all economic operators.

(10)

In order to assist market surveillance authorities to strengthen consistency in their activities related to the application of this Regulation, an effective peer review system should be established for those market surveillance authorities wishing to participate.

(11)

Certain definitions currently set out in Regulation (EC) No 765/2008 should be aligned with definitions set out in other Union legal acts and, where appropriate, reflect the architecture of modern supply chains. The definition of ‘manufacturer’ in this Regulation should not relieve manufacturers of any obligations they might have under Union harmonisation legislation where specific definitions of manufacturer are applied, which might cover any natural or legal person who modifies a product already placed on the market in such a way that compliance with the applicable Union harmonisation legislation might be affected and places it on the market, or any other natural or legal person who places a product on the market under its name or trade mark.

(12)

Economic operators throughout the entire supply chain should be expected to act responsibly and in full accordance with the legal requirements applicable when placing or making products available on the market, so as to ensure compliance with the Union harmonisation legislation on products. This Regulation should be without prejudice to the obligations corresponding to the roles of each of the economic operators in the supply and distribution process pursuant to specific provisions in Union harmonisation legislation, and the manufacturer should retain ultimate responsibility for compliance of the product with requirements of the Union harmonisation legislation.

(13)

The challenges of the global market and increasingly complex supply chains, as well as the increase of products that are offered for sale online to end users within the Union, call for the strengthening of enforcement measures, to ensure the safety of consumers. Furthermore, practical experience of market surveillance has shown that such supply chains sometimes involve economic operators whose novel form means that they do not fit easily into the traditional supply chains according to the existing legal framework. Such is the case, in particular, with fulfilment service providers, which perform many of the same functions as importers but which might not always correspond to the traditional definition of importer in Union law. In order to ensure that market surveillance authorities can carry out their responsibilities effectively and to avoid a gap in the enforcement system, it is appropriate to include fulfilment service providers within the list of economic operators against whom it is possible for market surveillance authorities to take enforcement measures. By including fulfilment service providers within the scope of this Regulation, market surveillance authorities will be better able to deal with new forms of economic activity in order to ensure the safety of consumers and the smooth functioning of the internal market, including where the economic operator acts both as an importer as regards certain products and as a fulfilment service provider as regards other products.

(14)

Modern supply chains encompass a wide variety of economic operators who should all be subject to enforcement of Union harmonisation legislation, while taking due consideration of their respective roles in the supply chain, and the extent to which they contribute to the making available of products on the Union market. Therefore, it is necessary to apply this Regulation to economic operators that are directly concerned by Union harmonisation legislation listed in Annex I to this Regulation, such as the producer of an article and the downstream user as defined in Regulation (EC) No 1907/2006 of the European Parliament and of the Council (9) and in Regulation (EC) No 1272/2008 of the European Parliament and of the Council (10), the installer as defined in Directive 2014/33/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council (11), the supplier as defined in Regulation (EC) No 1222/2009 of the European Parliament and of the Council (12) or the dealer as defined in Regulation (EU) 2017/1369 of the European Parliament and of the Council (13).

(15)

In the case of a product offered for sale online or through other means of distance sales, the product should be considered to have been made available on the market if the offer for sale is targeted at end users in the Union. In line with the applicable Union rules on private international law, a case-by-case analysis should be carried out in order to establish whether an offer is targeted at end users in the Union. An offer for sale should be considered to be targeted at end users in the Union if the relevant economic operator directs, by any means, its activities to a Member State. For the case-by-case analyses, relevant factors, such as the geographical areas to which dispatch is possible, the languages available, used for the offer or for ordering, or means of payment, need to be taken into consideration. In the case of online sales, the mere fact that the economic operators' or the intermediaries' website is accessible in the Member State in which the end user is established or domiciled is insufficient.

(16)

The development of e-commerce is also due, to a great extent, to the proliferation of information society service providers, usually through platforms and for remuneration, which offer intermediary services by storing third party content, without exercising control over that content, and therefore not acting on behalf of an economic operator. Removal of content regarding non-compliant products or, where this is not feasible, restricting access to non-compliant products offered through their services should be without prejudice to the rules laid down in Directive 2000/31/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council (14). In particular, no general obligation should be imposed on information society service providers to monitor the information which they transmit or store, nor should a general obligation be imposed upon them to actively seek facts or circumstances indicating illegal activity. Furthermore, hosting service providers should not be held liable as long as they do not have actual knowledge of illegal activity or information and are not aware of the facts or circumstances from which the illegal activity or information is apparent.

(17)

While this Regulation does not deal with the protection of intellectual property rights, it should nevertheless be borne in mind that often counterfeit products do not comply with the requirements set out in the Union harmonisation legislation, present risks to health and safety of end users, distort competition, endanger public interests and support other illegal activities. Therefore, Member States should continue taking effective measures to prevent counterfeit products from entering the Union market pursuant to Regulation (EU) No 608/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council (15).

(18)

A fairer single market should ensure equal conditions for competition to all economic operators and protection against unfair competition. To this end, strengthened enforcement of Union harmonisation legislation on products is necessary. Good cooperation between manufacturers and the market surveillance authorities is a key element, allowing immediate intervention and corrective action in relation to the product. It is important that, for certain products, there should be an economic operator established in the Union so that market surveillance authorities have someone to whom requests can be addressed, including requests for information regarding a product's compliance with Union harmonisation legislation, and who can cooperate with market surveillance authorities in making sure that immediate corrective action is taken to remedy instances of non-compliance. The economic operators who should perform those tasks are the manufacturer, or the importer when the manufacturer is not established in the Union, or an authorised representative mandated by the manufacturer for this purpose, or a fulfilment service provider established in the Union for products handled by it when no other economic operator is established in the Union.

(19)

The development of e-commerce poses certain challenges for market surveillance authorities with regard to the ensuring of compliance of products offered for sale online and the effective enforcement of Union harmonisation legislation. The number of economic operators offering products directly to consumers by electronic means is increasing. Therefore, economic operators with tasks regarding products subject to certain Union harmonisation legislation perform an essential role by providing market surveillance authorities with an interlocutor established in the Union, and by performing specific tasks in a timely manner to make sure that the products comply with the requirements of Union harmonisation legislation, for the benefit of consumers, other end users and businesses within the Union.

(20)

The obligations of the economic operator with tasks regarding products subject to certain Union harmonisation legislation should be without prejudice to existing obligations and responsibilities of manufacturer, importer and authorised representative under the relevant Union harmonisation legislation.

(21)

Obligations of this Regulation requiring an economic operator to be established in the Union in order to place products on the Union's market should only apply to areas where the need for an economic operator to act as a liaison point with the market surveillance authorities has been identified, taking into account a risk-based approach, having regard to the principle of proportionality, and taking into account high level of protection of end users in the Union.

(22)

Moreover, those obligations should not apply where the specific requirements set out in certain legal acts on products achieve in effect the same result, namely Regulation (EC) No 648/2004 of the European Parliament and of the Council (16), Regulation (EC) No 1223/2009, Regulation (EU) No 167/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council (17), Regulation (EU) No 168/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council (18), Directive 2014/28/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council (19), Directive 2014/90/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council (20), Regulation (EU) 2016/1628 of the European Parliament and of the Council (21), Regulation (EU) 2017/745, Regulation (EU) 2017/746, Regulation (EU) 2017/1369 and Regulation (EU) 2018/858.

Consideration should also be given to situations where potential risks or cases of non-compliance are low, or in which products are mainly traded through traditional supply chains, which is the case, for instance, for Directive 2014/33/EU, Regulation (EU) 2016/424 of the European Parliament and of the Council (22) and Directive 2010/35/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council (23).

(23)

Contact information of economic operators with tasks regarding products subject to certain Union harmonisation legislation should be indicated with the product in order to facilitate checks throughout the supply chain.

(24)

Economic operators should fully cooperate with market surveillance authorities and other competent authorities to ensure the smooth performance of market surveillance and to enable the authorities to perform their tasks. This includes, where requested by authorities, providing the contact information of the economic operators with tasks regarding products subject to certain Union harmonisation legislation where this information is available to them.

(25)

Economic operators should have easy access to high quality, comprehensive information. Since the single digital gateway established under Regulation (EU) 2018/1724 of the European Parliament and of the Council (24) provides for a single point of online access to information, it can be used in respect to providing relevant information on Union harmonisation legislation to economic operators. Nevertheless, Member States should put in place procedures for ensuring access to the Product Contact Points established under Regulation (EU) 2019/515 of the European Parliament and of the Council (25) in order to assist the economic operators in addressing properly their requests for information. Guidance on issues relating to technical specifications or harmonised standards or design of a specific product should not be part of the obligations of Member States when providing such information.

(26)

Market surveillance authorities might carry out joint activities with other authorities or organisations representing economic operators or end users, with a view to promoting compliance, identifying non-compliance, raising awareness and providing guidance on Union harmonisation legislation and with respect to specific categories of products, including those that are offered for sale online.

(27)

Member States should designate their own market surveillance authorities. This Regulation should not prevent Member States from choosing the competent authorities to carry out the market surveillance tasks. In order to facilitate administrative assistance and cooperation, Member States should also appoint a single liaison office. Single liaison offices should at least represent the coordinated position of the market surveillance authorities and the authorities in charge of the control on products entering the Union market.

(28)

E-commerce poses certain challenges for market surveillance authorities regarding the protection of the health and safety of end users from non-compliant products. Therefore, Member States should ensure their market surveillance is organised with the same effectiveness for products made available online as it is for products made available offline.

(29)

While performing market surveillance of products offered for sale online, market surveillance authorities are facing numerous difficulties, such as tracing products offered for sale online, identifying the responsible economic operators, or conducting risk-assessments or tests due to the lack of physical access to products. In addition to the requirements introduced by this Regulation, Member States are encouraged to use complementary guidance and best practices for market surveillance and for communication with businesses and consumers.

(30)

Special attention should be given to emerging technologies, taking into account that consumers are increasingly using connected devices in their daily lives. The Union regulatory framework should therefore address the new risks to ensure the safety of the end users.

(31)

In the age of constant development of digital technologies new solutions that could contribute to the effective market surveillance within the Union should be explored.

(32)

Market surveillance should be thorough and effective, to ensure that Union harmonisation legislation on products is applied correctly. Given that controls may represent a burden for economic operators, market surveillance authorities should organise and conduct inspection activities on a risk-based approach, taking the interests of those economic operators into account and limiting the said burden to what is necessary for the performance of efficient and effective controls. Furthermore, market surveillance should be performed with the same level of care by the competent authorities of the Member State irrespective of whether non-compliance of the given product is relevant on the territory of that Member State or is likely to have an impact on the market of another Member State. Uniform conditions for certain inspection activities carried out by the market surveillance authorities where products or categories of products present specific risks or seriously breach the applicable Union harmonisation legislation might be laid down by the Commission.

(33)

Market surveillance authorities, when performing their duties, are confronted with different shortcomings in terms of resources, coordination mechanisms, as well as powers with regard to non-compliant products. Such differences lead to fragmented enforcement of Union harmonisation legislation and to market surveillance being more rigorous in some Member States than in others, potentially compromising the level playing field among businesses and creating also potential imbalances in the level of product safety throughout the Union.

(34)

In order to ensure that the Union harmonisation legislation on products is correctly enforced, market surveillance authorities should have a common set of investigative and enforcement powers, allowing for enhanced cooperation between market surveillance authorities and more effective deterrence for economic operators that willingly infringe Union harmonisation legislation. Those powers should be sufficiently robust to tackle the enforcement challenges of Union harmonisation legislation, along with the challenges of e-commerce and the digital environment and to prevent economic operators from exploiting gaps in the enforcement system by relocating to Member States whose market surveillance authorities are not equipped to tackle unlawful practices. In particular, the powers should ensure that information and evidence can be exchanged between competent authorities so that enforcement can be undertaken equally in all Member States.

(35)

This Regulation should be without prejudice to the freedom of Member States to choose the enforcement system that they consider to be appropriate. Member States should be free to choose whether their market surveillance authorities can exercise investigation and enforcement directly under their own authority, by recourse to other public authorities or upon application to the competent courts.

(36)

Market surveillance authorities should be in a position to open investigations on their own initiative if they become aware of non-compliant products placed on the market.

(37)

Market surveillance authorities should have access to all necessary evidence, data and information relating to the subject matter of an investigation in order to determine whether applicable Union harmonisation legislation has been infringed, and in particular to identify the economic operator responsible, irrespective of who possesses the evidence, data or information in question and regardless of where it is located and of the format in which it is held. Market surveillance authorities should be able to request economic operators, including those in the digital value chain, to provide all the evidence, data and information necessary.

(38)

Market surveillance authorities should be able to carry out the necessary on-site inspections, and should have the power to enter any premises, land or means of transport, that the economic operator uses for purposes relating to its trade, business, craft or profession.

(39)

Market surveillance authorities should be able to require a representative or a relevant member of staff of the economic operator concerned to give explanations or provide facts, information or documents relating to the subject matter of the on-site inspection, and to record the answers given by that representative or relevant member of staff.

(40)

Market surveillance authorities should be able to check the compliance of products to be made available on the market with Union harmonisation legislation and to obtain evidence of non-compliance. They should, therefore, have the power to acquire products and, where the evidence cannot be obtained by other means, to purchase products under a cover identity.

(41)

In the digital environment in particular, market surveillance authorities should be able to bring non-compliance to an end quickly and effectively, notably where the economic operator selling the product conceals its identity or relocates within the Union or to a third country in order to avoid enforcement. In cases where there is a risk of serious and irreparable harm to end users due to non-compliance, market surveillance authorities should be able to take measures, where duly justified and proportionate and where there are no other means available to prevent or mitigate such harm, including, where necessary, requiring the removal of content from the online interface or the display of a warning. When such a request is not observed, the relevant authority should have the power to require information society service providers to restrict access to the online interface. These measures should be taken in accordance with the principles laid down in Directive 2000/31/EC.

(42)

The implementation of this Regulation and the exercise of powers in its application should also comply with other Union and national law, for example Directive 2000/31/EC, including with applicable procedural safeguards and principles of the fundamental rights. That implementation and that exercise of powers should also be proportionate and adequate in view of the nature and the overall actual or potential harm caused by the infringement. Competent authorities should take all facts and circumstances of the case into account and should choose the most appropriate measures, namely, those which are essential to address the infringement covered by this Regulation. Those measures should be proportionate, effective and dissuasive. Member States should remain free to set out conditions and limits for the exercise of the powers to fulfil duties in national law. Where, for example, in accordance with national law, prior authorisation to enter the premises of natural persons and legal persons is required from the judicial authority of the Member State concerned, the power to enter such premises should be used only after such prior authorisation has been obtained.

(43)

Market surveillance authorities act in the interest of economic operators, of end users, and of the public, to ensure that public interests covered by relevant Union harmonisation legislation on products are consistently preserved and protected through appropriate enforcement measures, and that compliance with such legislation is ensured across the supply chain through appropriate checks, taking into consideration the fact that administrative checks alone, in many cases, cannot replace physical and laboratory checks in order to verify the compliance of products with the relevant Union harmonisation legislation. Consequently, market surveillance authorities should ensure a high level of transparency while performing their activities and should make available to the public any information that they consider to be relevant in order to protect the interests of end users in the Union.

(44)

This Regulation should be without prejudice to the functioning of RAPEX in accordance with Directive 2001/95/EC.

(45)

This Regulation should be without prejudice to the safeguard clause procedure provided for by sectoral Union harmonisation legislation, pursuant to Article 114(10) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union. With a view to ensuring an equivalent level of protection throughout the Union, Member States are authorised to take measures in relation to products presenting a risk to health and safety, or other aspects of public interest protection. They are also required to notify those measures to other Member States and the Commission, allowing the Commission to take a position on whether national measures that restrict the free movement of products with a view to ensuring the functioning of the internal market are justified.

(46)

The exchange of information between market surveillance authorities, and the use of evidence and investigation findings should respect the principle of confidentiality. Information should be handled in accordance with applicable national law, in order to ensure that investigations are not compromised and that the reputation of the economic operator is not prejudiced.

(47)

Where, for the purposes of this Regulation, it is necessary to process personal data, this should be carried out in accordance with Union law on the protection of personal data. Any processing of personal data under this Regulation is subject to Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of the European Parliament and of the Council (26) and Regulation (EU) 2018/1725 of the European Parliament and of the Council (27), as applicable.

(48)

To ensure the effectiveness and consistency of testing across the Union in the market surveillance framework with regard to specific products or a specific category or group of products or for specific risks related to a category or group of products, the Commission might designate testing facilities of its own or public testing facilities of a Member State as a Union testing facility. All Union testing facilities should be accredited in accordance with the requirements of Regulation (EC) No 765/2008. In order to avoid conflicts of interests, Union testing facilities should only provide services to market surveillance authorities, the Commission, the Union Product Compliance Network (the ‘Network’) and other government or intergovernmental entities.

(49)

Member States should ensure that adequate financial resources are always available for the appropriate staffing and equipping of the market surveillance authorities. Efficient market surveillance is demanding in terms of resources, and stable resources should be provided at a level appropriate to the enforcement needs at any given moment. Member States should have the possibility to supplement public financing by reclaiming from the relevant economic operators the costs incurred when performing market surveillance in relation to products that were found to be non-compliant.

(50)

Mechanisms for mutual assistance should be established, since it is imperative for the Union market for goods that the market surveillance authorities of the Member States cooperate with each other effectively. Authorities should act in good faith and, as a general principle, accept requests for mutual assistance, in particular those concerning access to EU declaration of conformity, declaration of performance and technical documentation.

(51)

It is appropriate that Member States designate the authorities responsible for applying the customs legislation and any other authorities in charge under national law of control on products entering the Union market.

(52)

An effective way to ensure that unsafe or non-compliant products are not placed on the Union market would be to detect such products before they are released for free circulation. Authorities in charge of the control on products entering the Union market have a complete overview of trade flows across the Union's external borders and should therefore be required to carry out adequate controls on a risk assessment basis to contribute to a safer market place which ensures a high level of protection of public interests. It is for Member States to designate the specific authorities that are to be responsible for the appropriate documentary and, where necessary, physical or laboratory checks of products before those products are released for free circulation. A uniform enforcement of Union harmonisation legislation on products can only be achieved through systematic cooperation and exchange of information between market surveillance and other authorities designated as authorities in charge of the control on products entering the Union market. These authorities should receive well in advance from the market surveillance authorities all the necessary information concerning non-compliant products or information on economic operators where a higher risk of non-compliance has been identified. In turn, authorities in charge of the control on products entering the customs territory of the Union should inform the market surveillance authorities in a timely manner of the release of products for free circulation, and the results of controls, where such information is relevant for the enforcement of Union harmonisation legislation on products. Furthermore, where the Commission becomes aware of a serious risk presented by an imported product, it should inform the Member States about that risk in order to ensure coordinated and more effective compliance and enforcement controls at the first points of entry to the Union.

(53)

Importers should be reminded that Articles 220, 254, 256, 257 and 258 of Regulation (EU) No 952/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council (28) provide that products entering the Union market that require further processing in order to be in compliance with the applicable Union harmonisation legislation shall be placed under the appropriate customs procedure allowing such processing by the importer. Generally, the release for free circulation should not be deemed to be proof of conformity with Union law, since such a release does not necessarily include a complete check of compliance.

(54)

In order to use the EU Single Window environment for customs and therefore to optimise and unburden the data transfer between customs and market surveillance authorities, it is necessary to set up electronic interfaces that allow automatic data transfer. Customs and market surveillance authorities should contribute to determine the data to be transmitted. Additional burden for customs authorities should be limited and the interfaces should be highly automated and easy-to-use.

(55)

It is necessary to establish the Network, hosted by the Commission, aimed at structured coordination and cooperation between enforcement authorities of the Member States and the Commission, and at streamlining the practices of market surveillance within the Union that facilitate the implementation of joint enforcement activities by Member States, such as joint investigations. This administrative support structure should allow the pooling of resources and maintain a communication and information system between Member States and the Commission, thereby helping to strengthen enforcement of Union harmonisation legislation on products and to deter infringements. The involvement of administrative cooperation groups (ADCOs) in the Network should not preclude the involvement of other, similar, groups involved in administrative cooperation. The Commission should provide the necessary administrative and financial support to the Network.

(56)

There should be effective, speedy and accurate exchange of information among the Member States and the Commission. A number of existing tools, such as the information and communication system for market surveillance (ICSMS) and RAPEX enable coordination among market surveillance authorities in the Union. These tools, together with the interface permitting data transfer from ICSMS into RAPEX should be maintained and further developed in order to exploit their full potential and help to increase the level of cooperation and exchange of information between Member States and the Commission.

(57)

In that context, for the purpose of collecting information relating to the enforcement of Union harmonisation legislation on products, ICSMS should be upgraded and be accessible to the Commission, single liaison offices, customs and market surveillance authorities. Furthermore, an electronic interface should be developed to allow effective exchange of information between national systems of customs and market surveillance authorities. With regard to the cases of mutual assistance requests, the single liaison offices should give any support necessary for cooperation between the relevant authorities. Therefore, ICSMS should provide the functions enabling an automated indication to the single liaison offices when deadlines are not met. When sectoral legislation already provides for electronic systems for cooperation and data exchange, as is the case for example of EUDAMED for medical devices, those systems should be kept in use, when appropriate.

(58)

In general, ICSMS should be used to exchange information considered helpful for other market surveillance authorities. This might include checks undertaken in the context of market surveillance projects, regardless of the outcome of the tests. The amount of data to be entered in ICSMS should strike a balance between imposing too great a burden, when the efforts for entering the data would exceed the work involved in doing the actual checks, and being comprehensive enough to support greater efficiency and effectiveness on the side of the authorities. Thus, the data entered in ICSMS should also cover simpler checks than laboratory tests only. Nevertheless, there should be no need to include brief visual checks. As a guideline, checks which are individually documented should also be entered in ICSMS.

(59)

Member States are encouraged to use ICSMS for interactions between customs and market surveillance authorities as an alternative to the national systems. This should not replace the Community Risk Management System (CRMS) used by customs authorities. These two systems could work in parallel since they fulfil different, complementary roles, with ICSMS facilitating communication between customs and market surveillance authorities in order to allow for a smooth treatment of customs declarations in the scope of the product safety and compliance framework while CRMS is for customs common risk management and controls.

(60)

Injuries caused by non-compliant products are important information for market surveillance authorities. ICSMS should therefore provide for related data fields so that market surveillance authorities can enter readily available reports provided for in the course of their investigations, thus facilitating later statistical evaluations.

(61)

The Commission should be able to exchange market surveillance related information with regulatory authorities of third countries or international organisations within the framework of agreements concluded between the Union and third countries or international organisations, with a view to ensuring compliance of products prior to their export to the Union market.

(62)

In order to achieve a high degree of compliance with applicable Union harmonisation legislation on products while at the same time ensuring an effective resource-allocation and a cost-efficient control of products entering the Union market, the Commission should be able to approve specific pre-export control systems. Products falling under such approved systems might, as part of the risk assessment performed by authorities in charge of controls on products entering the Union market, benefit from a higher level of confidence than comparable products which have not been subject to a pre-export control.

(63)

The Commission should carry out an evaluation of this Regulation in light of the objective it pursues, and taking into consideration new technological, economic, commercial and legal developments. Pursuant to point 22 of the Interinstitutional Agreement of 13 April 2016 on Better L aw Making (29), the evaluation, based on efficiency, effectiveness, relevance, coherence and value added, should provide the basis for impact assessments of options for further action, particularly as regards the scope of this Regulation, the application and enforcement of the provisions related to the tasks of economic operators placing products on the market, and the system of product-related pre-export controls.

(64)

The financial interests of the Union should be protected through proportionate measures throughout the expenditure cycle, including the prevention, detection and investigation of irregularities, the recovery of funds lost, wrongly paid or incorrectly used and, where appropriate, administrative and financial penalties.

(65)

The diversity of sanctions across the Union is one of the main reasons for inadequate deterrence and uneven protection. Rules on establishing sanctions, including monetary penalties, are a matter of national jurisdiction and should, therefore, be determined by national law.

(66)

In order to ensure uniform conditions for the implementation of this Regulation, implementing powers should be conferred on the Commission in relation to: determining the uniform conditions for checks, criteria for determination of the frequency of checks and amount of samples to be checked in relation to certain products or categories of products, where specific risks or serious breaches of Union harmonisation legislation have been continuously identified; specifying the procedures for the designation of Union testing facilities; laying down benchmarks and techniques for checks on the basis of common risk analysis at the Union level; specifying the details of statistical data covering controls performed by the designated authorities with respect to products subject to Union law; specifying the details of implementation arrangements for the information and communication system and defining the data relating to the placing of products under the customs procedure ‘release for free circulation’ transmitted by customs authorities; and to the approval of specific systems of product-related pre-export controls and the withdrawal of such approvals. Those powers should be exercised in accordance with Regulation (EU) No 182/2011 of the European Parliament and of the Council (30).

(67)

Since the objective of this Regulation, namely to improve the functioning of the internal market by strengthening the market surveillance of products covered by Union harmonisation legislation, cannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member States given the need for a very high degree of cooperation, interaction and coherent action of all of the competent authorities in all Member States, but can rather, by reason of its scale and effects, be better achieved at Union level, the Union may adopt measures, in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity as set out in Article 5 of the Treaty on European Union. In accordance with the principle of proportionality as set out in that Article, this Regulation does not go beyond what is necessary in order to achieve that objective.

(68)

This Regulation respects fundamental rights and observes the principles recognised in particular by the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union and present in the constitutional traditions of Member States. Accordingly, this Regulation should be interpreted and applied in accordance with those rights and principles, including those related to the freedom and pluralism of the media. In particular, this Regulation seeks to ensure full respect for consumer protection, the freedom to conduct a business, the freedom of expression and information, the right to property and the protection of personal data,

CHAPTER II

TASKS OF ECONOMIC OPERATORS

Article 4

Tasks of economic operators regarding products subject to certain Union harmonisation legislation

1.   Notwithstanding any obligations set out in applicable Union harmonisation legislation, a product subject to legislation referred to in paragraph 5 may be placed on the market only if there is an economic operator established in the Union who is responsible for the tasks set out in paragraph 3 in respect of that product.

2.   For the purposes of this Article, the economic operator referred to in paragraph 1 means any of the following:

(a)

a manufacturer established in the Union;

(b)

an importer, where the manufacturer is not established in the Union;

(c)

an authorised representative who has a written mandate from the manufacturer designating the authorised representative to perform the tasks set out in paragraph 3 on the manufacturer's behalf;

(d)

a fulfilment service provider established in the Union with respect to the products it handles, where no other economic operator as mentioned in points (a), (b) and (c) is established in the Union.

3.   Without prejudice to any obligations of economic operators under the applicable Union harmonisation legislation, the economic operator referred to in paragraph 1 shall perform the following tasks:

(a)

if the Union harmonisation legislation applicable to the product provides for an EU declaration of conformity or declaration of performance and technical documentation, verifying that the EU declaration of conformity or declaration of performance and technical documentation have been drawn up, keeping the declaration of conformity or declaration of performance at the disposal of market surveillance authorities for the period required by that legislation and ensuring that the technical documentation can be made available to those authorities upon request;

(b)

further to a reasoned request from a market surveillance authority, providing that authority with all information and documentation necessary to demonstrate the conformity of the product in a language which can be easily understood by that authority;

(c)

when having reason to believe that a product in question presents a risk, informing the market surveillance authorities thereof;

(d)

cooperating with the market surveillance authorities, including following a reasoned request making sure that the immediate, necessary, corrective action is taken to remedy any case of non-compliance with the requirements set out in Union harmonisation legislation applicable to the product in question, or, if that is not possible, to mitigate the risks presented by that product, when required to do so by the market surveillance authorities or on its own initiative, where the economic operator referred to in paragraph 1 considers or has reason to believe that the product in question presents a risk.

4.   Without prejudice to the respective obligations of economic operators under the applicable Union harmonisation legislation, the name, registered trade name or registered trade mark, and contact details, including the postal address, of the economic operator referred to in paragraph 1 shall be indicated on the product or on its packaging, the parcel or an accompanying document.

5.   This Article only applies in relation to products that are subject to Regulations (EU) No 305/2011 (34), (EU) 2016/425 (35) and (EU) 2016/426 (36) of the European Parliament and of the Council, and Directives 2000/14/EC (37), 2006/42/EC (38), 2009/48/EC (39), 2009/125/EC (40), 2011/65/EU (41), 2013/29/EU (42), 2013/53/EU (43), 2014/29/EU (44), 2014/30/EU (45), 2014/31/EU (46), 2014/32/EU (47), 2014/34/EU (48), 2014/35/EU (49), 2014/53/EU (50) and 2014/68/EU (51) of the European Parliament and of the Council.

Article 5

Authorised representative

1.   For the purposes of point (c) of Article 4(2), the authorised representative shall be mandated by the manufacturer to perform the tasks listed in Article 4(3), notwithstanding any other tasks mandated under the relevant Union harmonisation legislation.

2.   The authorised representative shall perform the tasks specified in the mandate. It shall provide a copy of the mandate to the market surveillance authorities upon request, in a Union language determined by the market surveillance authority.

3.   Authorised representatives shall have the appropriate means to be able to fulfil their tasks.

Article 6

Distance sales

Products offered for sale online or through other means of distance sales shall be deemed to be made available on the market if the offer is targeted at end users in the Union. An offer for sale shall be considered to be targeted at end users in the Union if the relevant economic operator directs, by any means, its activities to a Member State.

Article 7

Obligation of cooperation

1.   Economic operators shall cooperate with market surveillance authorities regarding actions which could eliminate or mitigate risks that are presented by products made available on the market by those operators.

2.   Information society service providers shall cooperate with the market surveillance authorities, at the request of the market surveillance authorities and in specific cases, to facilitate any action taken to eliminate or, if that is not possible, to mitigate the risks presented by a product that is or was offered for sale online through their services.

CHAPTER III

ASSISTANCE TO AND COOPERATION WITH ECONOMIC OPERATORS

Article 8

Information to economic operators

1.   The Commission, in accordance with Regulation (EU) 2018/1724, shall ensure that the Your Europe portal provides users with easy online access to information about the product requirements and rights, obligations and rules derived from the Union harmonisation legislation.

2.   Member States shall put in place procedures for providing economic operators, at their request and free of charge, with information with respect to the national transposition and implementation of Union harmonisation legislation applicable to products. For this purpose, Article 9(1), (4) and (5) of Regulation (EU) 2019/515 shall apply.

Article 9

Joint activities to promote compliance

1.   Market surveillance authorities may agree with other relevant authorities or with organisations representing economic operators or end users on the carrying out of joint activities that have the aim of promoting compliance, identifying non-compliance, raising awareness and providing guidance in relation to the Union harmonisation legislation with respect to specific categories of products, in particular categories of products that are often found to present a serious risk, including products offered for sale online.

2.   The market surveillance authority in question and the parties referred to in paragraph 1 shall ensure that the agreement on joint activities does not lead to unfair competition between economic operators and does not affect the objectivity, independence and impartiality of the parties.

3.   A market surveillance authority may use any information resulting from joint activities carried out as part of any investigation regarding non-compliance that it undertakes.

4.   The market surveillance authority in question shall make the agreement on joint activities, including the names of the parties involved, available to the public and shall enter that agreement in the information and communication system referred to in Article 34. At the request of a Member State, the Network established under Article 29 shall assist in the drawing up of the agreement on joint activities.

CHAPTER IV

ORGANISATION, ACTIVITIES AND OBLIGATIONS OF MARKET SURVEILLANCE AUTHORITIES AND THE SINGLE LIAISON OFFICE

Article 10

Designation of market surveillance authorities and the single liaison office

1.   Member States shall organise and carry out market surveillance as provided for in this Regulation.

2.   For the purposes of paragraph 1 of this Article, each Member State shall designate one or more market surveillance authorities in its territory. Each Member State shall inform the Commission and the other Member States of its market surveillance authorities and the areas of competence of each of those authorities, using the information and communication system referred to in Article 34.

3.   Each Member State shall appoint a single liaison office.

4.   The single liaison office shall at least be responsible for representing the coordinated position of the market surveillance authorities and the authorities designated under Article 25(1) and for communicating the national strategies as set out in Article 13. The single liaison office shall also assist in the cooperation between market surveillance authorities in different Member States, as set out in Chapter VI.

5.   In order to carry out market surveillance of products made available online and offline with the same effectiveness for all distribution channels, Member States shall ensure that their market surveillance authorities and single liaison office have the necessary resources, including sufficient budgetary and other resources, such as a sufficient number of competent personnel, expertise, procedures and other arrangements for the proper performance of their duties.

6.

the taking of appropriate and proportionate measures where the economic operator fails to take corrective action.

2.   Market surveillance authorities shall exercise their powers and carry out their duties independently, impartially and without bias.

3.   Market surveillance authorities, as part of their activities set out in paragraph 1 of this Article, shall perform appropriate checks on the characteristics of products on an adequate scale, by means of documentary checks and, where appropriate, physical and laboratory checks based on adequate samples, prioritising their resources and actions to ensure effective market surveillance and taking into account the national market surveillance strategy referred to in Article 13.

In deciding on which checks to perform, on which types of products and on what scale, market surveillance authorities shall follow a risk-based approach taking into account the following factors:

(a)

possible hazards and non-compliance associated with the products and, where available, their occurrence on the market;

(b)

activities and operations under the control of the economic operator;

(c)

the economic operator's past record of non-compliance;

(d)

if relevant, the risk profiling performed by the authorities designated under Article 25(1);

(e)

consumer complaints and other information received from other authorities, economic operators, media and other sources that might indicate non-compliance.

4.   The Commission, after consulting the Network, may adopt implementing acts determining the uniform conditions of checks, criteria for determination of the frequency of checks and amount of samples to be checked in relation to certain products or categories of products, where specific risks or serious breaches of applicable Union harmonisation legislation have been continuously identified, in order to ensure high level of protection of health and safety or other public interests protected by that legislation. Those implementing acts shall be adopted in accordance with the examination procedure referred to in Article 43(2).

5.   Where economic operators present test reports or certificates attesting the conformity of their products with Union harmonisation legislation issued by a conformity assessment body accredited in accordance with Regulation (EC) No 765/2008, market surveillance authorities shall take due account of those reports or certificates.

6.   Evidence that is used by a market surveillance authority in one Member State may be used as part of investigations to verify product compliance carried out by market surveillance authorities in another Member State, without any further formal requirements.

7.   Market surveillance authorities shall establish the following procedures in connection with products subject to the Union harmonisation legislation:

(a)

procedures for following up on complaints or reports on issues relating to risks or non-compliance;

(b)

procedures for verifying that the corrective action that was to be taken by economic operators has been taken.

8.   With a view to ensuring communication and coordination with their counterparts in other Member States, market surveillance authorities shall actively participate in administrative cooperation groups (ADCOs) as referred to in Article 30(2).

9.   Without prejudice to any Union safeguard procedure pursuant to the applicable Union harmonisation legislation, products that have been deemed to be non-compliant on the basis of a decision of a market surveillance authority in one Member State shall be presumed to be non-compliant by market surveillance authorities in other Member States, unless a relevant market surveillance authority in another Member State concluded the contrary on the basis of its own investigation, taking into account the input, if any, provided by an economic operator.

Article 12

Peer reviews

1.   Peer reviews shall be organised for market surveillance authorities wishing to participate in such reviews, in order to strengthen consistency in market surveillance activities in relation to the application of this Regulation.

2.   The Network shall develop the methodology and the rolling plan for peer reviews among participating market surveillance authorities.

DIRECTIVE 2006/66/EC OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL

of 6 September 2006

on batteries and accumulators and waste batteries and accumulators and repealing Directive 91/157/EEC

(Text with EEA relevance)

THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,

Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, and in particular Article 175(1) thereof and Article 95(1) thereof in relation to Articles 4, 6 and 21 of this Directive,

Having regard to the proposal from the Commission (1),

Having regard to the opinion of the European Economic and Social Committee (2),

Having regard to the opinion of the Committee of Regions (3),

Acting in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 251 of the Treaty (4), in the light of the joint text approved by the Conciliation Committee on 22 June 2006,

Whereas:

(1)

It is desirable to harmonise national measures concerning batteries and accumulators and waste batteries and accumulators. The primary objective of this Directive is to minimise the negative impact of batteries and accumulators and waste batteries and accumulators on the environment, thus contributing to the protection, preservation and improvement of the quality of the environment. The legal base is therefore Article 175(1) of the Treaty. However, it is also appropriate to take measures at Community level on the basis of Article 95(1) of the Treaty to harmonise requirements concerning the heavy metal content and labelling of batteries and accumulators and so to ensure the smooth functioning of the internal market and avoid distortion of competition within the Community.

(2)

The Commission Communication of 30 July 1996 on the Review of the Community Strategy for Waste Management established guidelines for future Community waste policy. That Communication stresses the need to reduce the quantities of hazardous substances in waste and points out the potential benefits of Community-wide rules limiting the presence of such substances in products and in production processes. It further states that, where the generation of waste cannot be avoided, that waste should be reused or recovered for its material or energy.

(3)

The Council Resolution of 25 January 1988 on a Community action programme to combat environmental pollution by cadmium (5) stressed the limitation of the uses of cadmium to cases where suitable alternatives do not exist and the collection and recycling of batteries containing cadmium as major elements of the strategy for cadmium control in the interests of the protection of human health and the environment.

(4)

Council Directive 91/157/EEC of 18 March 1991 on batteries and accumulators containing certain dangerous substances (6) has brought about an approximation of Member States' laws in this field. However, the objectives of that Directive have not been fully attained. Decision No 1600/2002/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 22 July 2002 laying down the Sixth Community Environment Action Programme (7) and Directive 2002/96/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 27 January 2003 on waste electrical and electronic equipment (WEEE) (8) also underlined the need for Directive 91/157/EEC to be revised. Directive 91/157/EEC should therefore be revised and replaced in the interests of clarity.

(5)

In order to achieve its environmental aims, this Directive prohibits the placing on the market of certain batteries and accumulators containing mercury or cadmium. It also promotes a high level of collection and recycling of waste batteries and accumulators and improved environmental performance of all operators involved in the life cycle of batteries and accumulators, e.g. producers, distributors and end-users and, in particular, those operators directly involved in the treatment and recycling of waste batteries and accumulators. The specific rules needed to do this are supplementary to existing Community legislation on waste, in particular Directive 2006/12/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 5 April 2006 on waste (9), Council Directive 1999/31/EC of 26 April 1999 on the landfill of waste (10) and Directive 2000/76/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 4 December 2000 on the incineration of waste (11).

(6)

In order to prevent waste batteries and accumulators from being discarded in such a way as to pollute the environment, and to avoid end-user confusion about the different waste management requirements for different batteries and accumulators, this Directive should apply to all batteries and accumulators placed on the market within the Community. Such a wide scope should also ensure economies of scale in collection and recycling, as well as optimal resource saving.

(7)

Reliable batteries and accumulators are fundamental for the safety of many products, appliances and services, and are an essential energy source in our society.

(8)

It is appropriate to distinguish between portable batteries and accumulators on the one hand and industrial and automotive batteries and accumulators on the other. The disposal of industrial and automotive batteries and accumulators in landfill sites or by incineration should be prohibited.

(9)

Examples of industrial batteries and accumulators include batteries and accumulators used for emergency or back-up power supply in hospitals, airports or offices, batteries and accumulators used in trains or aircraft and batteries and accumulators used on offshore oil rigs or in lighthouses. Examples also include batteries and accumulators designed exclusively for hand-held payment terminals in shops and restaurants, bar code readers in shops, professional video equipment for TV channels and professional studios, miners' lamps and diving lamps attached to mining and diving helmets for professionals, back up batteries and accumulators for electric doors to prevent them from blocking or crushing people, batteries and accumulators used for instrumentation or in various types of measurement and instrumentation equipment and batteries and accumulators used in connection with solar panel, photo-voltaic, and other renewable energy applications. Industrial batteries and accumulators also include batteries and accumulators used in electrical vehicles, such as electric cars, wheelchairs, bicycles, airport vehicles and automatic transport vehicles. In addition to this non exhaustive list of examples, any battery or accumulator that is not sealed and not automotive should be considered industrial.

(10)

Examples of portable batteries and accumulators, which are all-sealed batteries and accumulators that an average person could carry by hand without difficulty and that are neither automotive batteries or accumulators nor industrial batteries or accumulators, include single cell batteries (such as AA and AAA batteries) and batteries and accumulators used by consumers or professionals in mobile telephones, portable computers, cordless power tools, toys and household appliances such as electric toothbrushes, razors and hand-held vacuum cleaners (including similar equipment used in schools, shops, restaurants, airports, offices or hospitals) and any battery or accumulator that consumers may use for normal household applications.

(11)

The Commission should evaluate the need for adaptation of this Directive, taking account of available technical and scientific evidence. In particular, the Commission should carry out a review of the exemption from the cadmium ban provided for portable batteries and accumulators intended for use in cordless power tools. Examples of cordless power tools are tools that consumers and professionals use for turning, milling, sanding, grinding, sawing, cutting, shearing, drilling, making holes, punching, hammering, riveting, screwing, polishing or similar processing of wood, metal and other materials, as well as for mowing, cutting and other gardening activities.

(12)

The Commission should also monitor, and Member States should encourage, technological developments that improve the environmental performance of batteries and accumulators throughout their entire life cycle, including through participation in a Community eco-management and audit scheme (EMAS).

(13)

In order to protect the environment, waste batteries and accumulators should be collected. For portable batteries and accumulators, collection schemes achieving a high collection rate should be established. This means setting up collection schemes so that end-users can discard all waste portable batteries and accumulators conveniently and free of charge. Different collection schemes and financing arrangements are appropriate for the different battery and accumulator types.

(14)

It is desirable for Member States to achieve a high collection and recycling rate for waste batteries and accumulators so as to achieve a high level of environmental protection and material recovery throughout the Community. This Directive should therefore set minimum collection and recycling targets for Member States. It is appropriate to calculate the collection rate on the basis of average annual sales in preceding years, so as to have comparable targets for all Member States that are proportionate to the national level of battery and accumulator consumption.

(15)

Specific recycling requirements should be established for cadmium and lead batteries and accumulators in order to attain a high level of material recovery throughout the Community and to prevent disparities between Member States.

(16)

All interested parties should be able to participate in collection, treatment and recycling schemes. Those schemes should be designed to avoid discrimination against imported batteries and accumulators, barriers to trade or distortions of competition.

(17)

Collection and recycling schemes should be optimised, in particular in order to minimise costs and the negative environmental impact of transport. Treatment and recycling schemes should use best available techniques, as defined in Article 2(11) of Council Directive 96/61/EC of 24 September 1996 concerning integrated pollution prevention and control (12). The definition of recycling should exclude energy recovery. The concept of energy recovery is defined in other Community instruments.

(18)

Batteries and accumulators can be collected individually, by way of national battery collection schemes or together with waste electrical and electronic equipment, by way of national collection schemes set up on the basis of Directive 2002/96/EC. In the latter case, as an obligatory minimum treatment requirement, batteries and accumulators should be removed from the collected waste electrical and electronic equipment. After their removal from the waste electrical and electronic equipment, batteries and accumulators are subject to the requirements of this Directive, notably they count for achieving the collection target and are subject to recycling requirements.

(19)

Basic principles for financing the management of waste batteries and accumulators should be set at Community level. Financing schemes should help to achieve high collection and recycling rates and to give effect to the principle of producer responsibility. All producers as defined by this Directive should be registered. Producers should finance the costs of collecting, treating and recycling all collected batteries and accumulators minus the profit made by selling the materials recovered. However, under certain circumstances, the application of de minimis rules to small producers could be justified.

(20)

The provision of information to end-users on the desirability of separate collection, the collection schemes available and end-users' role in the management of waste batteries and accumulators is necessary for successful collection. Detailed arrangements should be made for a labelling system, which should provide end-users with transparent, reliable and clear information on batteries and accumulators and any heavy metals they contain.

(21)

If, in order to achieve the objectives of this Directive, and, in particular, to achieve high separate collection and recycling rates, Member States use economic instruments, such as differential tax rates, they should inform the Commission accordingly.

(22)

Reliable and comparable data on the quantities of batteries and accumulators placed on the market collected and recycled are necessary for monitoring whether the objectives of this Directive have been achieved.

(23)

Member States should lay down rules on the penalties applicable to infringements of the provisions of this Directive and ensure that they are implemented. Those penalties should be effective, proportionate and dissuasive.

(24)

In accordance with paragraph 34 of the Interinstitutional agreement on better law-making (13), Member States are encouraged to draw up, for themselves and in the interests of the Community, their own tables, which will, as far as possible, illustrate the correlation between this Directive and the transposition measures and to make them public.

(25)

The measures necessary for the implementation of this Directive should be adopted in accordance with Council Decision 1999/468/EC of 28 June 1999 laying down the procedures for the exercise of implementing powers conferred on the Commission (14).

(26)

Since the objectives of this Directive namely protecting the environment and ensuring the proper functioning of the internal market cannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member States and can therefore, by reason of the scale or effects of the action, be better achieved at Community level, the Community may adopt measures, in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity as set out in Article 5 of the Treaty. In accordance with the principle of proportionality, as set out in that Article, this Directive does not go beyond what is necessary in order to achieve those objectives.

(27)

This Directive applies without prejudice to Community legislation on safety, quality and health requirements and specific Community waste management legislation, in particular Directive 2000/53/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 18 September 2000 on end-of-life vehicles (15) and Directive 2002/96/EC.

(28)

As regards producer responsibility, producers of batteries and accumulators and producers of other products incorporating a battery or accumulator are responsible for the waste management of batteries and accumulators that they place on the market. A flexible approach is appropriate to enable financing schemes to reflect differing national circumstances and to take account of existing schemes, particularly those set up to comply with Directives 2000/53/EC and 2002/96/EC, while avoiding double charging.

(29)

Directive 2002/95/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 27 January 2003 on the restriction of the use of certain hazardous substances in electrical and electronic equipment (16) does not apply to batteries and accumulators used in electrical and electronic equipment.

(30)

Automotive and industrial batteries and accumulators used in vehicles should meet the requirements of Directive 2000/53/EC, in particular Article 4 thereof. Therefore the use of cadmium in industrial batteries and accumulators for electrical vehicles should be prohibited, unless they can benefit from an exemption on the basis of Annex II to that Directive,

HAVE ADOPTED THIS DIRECTIVE:

DIRECTIVE (EU) 2018/849 OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL

of 30 May 2018

amending Directives 2000/53/EC on end-of-life vehicles, 2006/66/EC on batteries and accumulators and waste batteries and accumulators, and 2012/19/EU on waste electrical and electronic equipment

(Text with EEA relevance)

THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,

Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, and in particular Article 192(1) thereof,

Having regard to the proposal from the European Commission,

After transmission of the draft legislative act to the national parliaments,

Having regard to the opinion of the European Economic and Social Committee (1),

Having regard to the opinion of the Committee of the Regions (2),

Acting in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure (3),

Whereas:

(1)

Waste management in the Union should be improved, with a view to protecting, preserving and improving the quality of the environment, protecting human health, ensuring prudent, efficient and rational utilisation of natural resources and promoting the principles of the circular economy.

(2)

To reduce the regulatory burden on small establishments or undertakings, simplification of the permitting and registration requirements for small establishments or undertakings should be introduced.

(3)

Implementation reports prepared by Member States every three years have not proved to be an effective tool for verifying compliance or ensuring good implementation, and are generating unnecessary administrative burdens. It is therefore appropriate to repeal provisions obliging Member States to produce such reports. Instead, compliance monitoring should be exclusively based on the data which Member States report every year to the Commission.

(4)

Data reported by Member States are essential for the Commission to assess compliance with Union waste law by Member States. The quality, reliability and comparability of data should be improved by introducing a single entry point for all waste data, deleting obsolete reporting requirements, benchmarking national reporting methodologies and introducing a data quality check report.

(5)

Reliable reporting of data concerning waste management is paramount to efficient implementation and to ensuring comparability of data among Member States. Therefore, when reporting on attainment of the targets set out in Directives 2000/53/EC (4), 2006/66/EC (5) and 2012/19/EU (6) of the European Parliament and of the Council, Member States should use the most recent rules developed by the Commission and methodologies developed by the respective national competent authorities responsible for implementing those Directives.

(6)

The waste hierarchy laid down in Directive 2008/98/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council (7) applies as an order of priority in Union waste prevention and management legislation. When complying with the objectives of this Directive, Member States should take the necessary measures to take the order of priorities of the waste hierarchy into account and ensure the practical implementation of those priorities.

(7)

In the context of the Union’s commitment to making the transition towards a circular economy, Directives 2000/53/EC, 2006/66/EC and 2012/19/EU should be reviewed and, if necessary, amended, taking account of their implementation and giving consideration, inter alia, to the feasibility of setting targets for specific materials contained in the relevant waste streams. During the review of Directive 2000/53/EC, attention should also be paid to the problem of end-of-life vehicles that are not accounted for, including the shipment of used vehicles suspected to be end-of-life vehicles, and to the application of the Correspondents’ Guidelines No 9 on shipments of waste vehicles. During the review of Directive 2006/66/EC, the technical development of new types of batteries that do not use hazardous substances should also be taken into account.

(8)

In order to amend and supplement Directive 2000/53/EC and to amend Directive 2012/19/EU, the power to adopt acts in accordance with Article 290 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union should be delegated to the Commission in respect of point (b) of Article 4(2) and Articles 5(5), 6(6) and 8(2) of Directive 2000/53/EC, as amended by this Directive, and Article 19 of Directive 2012/19/EU, as amended by this Directive. It is of particular importance that the Commission carry out appropriate consultations during its preparatory work, including at expert level, and that those consultations be conducted in accordance with the principles laid down in the Interinstitutional Agreement of 13 April 2016 on Better Law-Making (8). In particular, to ensure equal participation in the preparation of delegated acts, the European Parliament and the Council receive all documents at the same time as Member States’ experts, and their experts systematically have access to meetings of Commission expert groups dealing with the preparation of delegated acts.

(9)

In order to ensure uniform conditions for the implementation of Directive 2000/53/EC in respect of Articles 7(2) and 9(1d) thereof as amended by this Directive, and for the implementation of Directive 2012/19/EU in respect of Article 16(9) thereof as amended by this Directive, implementing powers should be conferred on the Commission. Those powers should be exercised in accordance with Regulation (EU) No 182/2011 of the European Parliament and of the Council (9).

(10)

Since the objectives of this Directive, namely to improve the waste management in the Union, and thereby to contribute to the protection, preservation and improvement of the quality of the environment and to the prudent and rational utilisation of natural resources, cannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member States, but can rather, by reason of the scale and effects of the measures, be better achieved at Union level, the Union may adopt measures, in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity as set out in Article 5 of the Treaty on European Union. In accordance with the principle of proportionality, as set out in that Article, this Directive does not go beyond what is necessary in order to achieve those objectives.

(11)

Directives 2000/53/EC, 2006/66/EC and 2012/19/EU should therefore be amended accordingly.

(12)

In accordance with the Joint Political Declaration of 28 September 2011 of Member States and the Commission on explanatory documents (10), Member States have undertaken to accompany, in justified cases, the notification of their transposition measures with one or more documents explaining the relationship between the components of a directive and the corresponding parts of national transposition instruments. With regard to this Directive, the legislator considers the transmission of such documents to be justified,

REGULATION (EU) 2023/1542 OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL

of 12 July 2023

concerning batteries and waste batteries, amending Directive 2008/98/EC and Regulation (EU) 2019/1020 and repealing Directive 2006/66/EC

(Text with EEA relevance)

THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,

Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, and in particular Article 114 thereof and Article 192(1) thereof in relation to Articles 54 to 76 of this Regulation,

Having regard to the proposal from the European Commission,

After transmission of the draft legislative act to the national parliaments,

Having regard to the opinion of the European Economic and Social Committee (1),

After consulting the Committee of the Regions,

Acting in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure (2),

Whereas:

(1)

The Communication of the Commission of 11 December 2019 on ‘The European Green Deal’ (the ‘European Green Deal’) is Europe’s growth strategy that aims to transform the Union into a fair and prosperous society, with a modern, resource-efficient and competitive economy where there are no net greenhouse gas emissions in 2050 and where economic growth is decoupled from resource use. A shift from the use of fossil fuels in vehicles to electromobility is one of the prerequisites for reaching the climate neutrality goal in 2050. In order for the Union’s product policies to contribute to lowering carbon emissions on a global level, it needs to be ensured that products marketed and sold in the Union are sourced and manufactured in a sustainable manner.

(2)

Batteries are thus an important source of energy and one of the key enablers for sustainable development, green mobility, clean energy and climate neutrality. It is expected that the demand for batteries will grow rapidly in the coming years, notably for electric road transport vehicles and light means of transport using batteries for traction, making the market for batteries an increasingly strategic one at the global level. Significant scientific and technical progress in the field of battery technology will continue. In view of the strategic importance of batteries, to provide legal certainty to all operators involved and to avoid discrimination, barriers to trade and distortions on the market for batteries, it is necessary to set out rules on the sustainability, performance, safety, collection, recycling and second life of batteries as well as on information about batteries for end-users and economic operators. It is necessary to create a harmonised regulatory framework for dealing with the entire life cycle of batteries that are placed on the market in the Union.

(3)

It is also necessary to update Union law on the management of waste batteries and to take measures to protect the environment and human health by preventing or reducing the adverse impacts of the generation and management of waste, by reducing the impact of resource use and by improving resource efficiency. Such measures are crucial for the transition to a circular and climate-neutral economy and toxic-free environment, and for the Union’s long-term competitiveness and strategic autonomy. They can create important economic opportunities, increasing synergies between the circular economy and energy, climate, transport, industry and research policies, and protecting the environment and reducing greenhouse gas emissions.

(4)

Directive 2006/66/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council (3) has brought about an improvement in the environmental performance of batteries and established some common rules and obligations for economic operators, in particular through harmonised rules for the heavy metal content and labelling of batteries and rules and targets for the management of all waste batteries, based on extended producer responsibility.

(5)

The Commission’s reports on the implementation, impact and evaluation of Directive 2006/66/EC submitted in 2019 highlighted not only the achievements but also the limitations of that Directive, in particular against a fundamentally changed context characterised by the strategic importance of batteries and their increased use.

(6)

The Communication of the Commission of 17 May 2018 on ‘Europe on the move – Sustainable Mobility for Europe: safe, connected and clean’ includes the Strategic Action Plan on Batteries. That action plan sets out measures to support efforts to build a battery value chain in Europe, covering raw materials extraction, sustainable sourcing and processing, sustainable battery materials, cell manufacturing as well as re-use and recycling of batteries.

(7)

In the European Green Deal, the Commission confirmed its commitment to implement the Strategic Action Plan on Batteries and stated that it would propose legislation to ensure a safe, circular and sustainable battery value chain for all batteries, including to supply the growing market of electric vehicles.

(8)

In its conclusions of 4 October 2019 on ‘More circularity – Transition to a sustainable society’, the Council called, inter alia, for coherent policies supporting the development of technologies that improve the sustainability and circularity of batteries to accompany the transition to electro-mobility. Furthermore, the Council called for an urgent revision of Directive 2006/66/EC, which should include all relevant battery materials and which should consider, in particular, specific requirements for lithium and cobalt as well as a mechanism allowing the adaptation of that Directive to future changes in battery technologies.

(9)

The Communication of the Commission of 11 March 2020 on ‘A new Circular Economy Action Plan – For a cleaner and more competitive Europe’ states that the proposal for a new regulatory framework for batteries will consider rules on recycled content and measures to improve the collection and recycling rates of all batteries, in order to ensure the recovery of valuable materials and to provide guidance to consumers and will address the possible phasing out of non-rechargeable batteries where alternatives exist. Furthermore, it is stated that sustainability and transparency requirements will be considered, taking into account the carbon footprint of battery manufacturing, the ethical sourcing of raw materials and the security of supply in order to facilitate re-use, repurposing and recycling of batteries.

(10)

Addressing the entire life cycle of all batteries placed on the Union market requires the setting up of harmonised product and marketing requirements, including conformity assessment procedures, as well as requirements to fully address the end-of-life stage of batteries. Requirements concerning the end-of-life stage are necessary to address the environmental implications of the batteries and, in particular, to support the creation of recycling markets for batteries and markets for secondary raw materials from waste batteries. In order to reach the envisaged objectives of addressing the whole life cycle of a battery in one legal instrument while avoiding barriers to trade and a distortion of competition and safeguarding the integrity of the internal market, the rules setting out the requirements for batteries should be of uniform application for all economic operators across the Union and not leave room for divergent implementation by Member States. Directive 2006/66/EC should therefore be replaced by a Regulation.

(11)

This Regulation should apply to all categories of batteries placed on the market or put into service within the Union, regardless of whether they were produced in the Union or imported. It should apply regardless of whether a battery is incorporated into appliances, light means of transport or other vehicles or otherwise added to products or whether a battery is placed on the market or put into service within the Union on its own. This Regulation should apply regardless of whether a battery is specifically designed for a product or is of general use and regardless of whether it is incorporated into a product or is supplied together with or separately from a product in which it is to be used. Placing on the market is considered to take place when the battery has been made available for the first time on the Union market, by being supplied by the manufacturer or importer for distribution, consumption or use in the course of a commercial activity, whether in return for payment or free of charge. Thus, batteries placed in stock in the Union by distributors, including retailers, wholesalers and sales divisions of manufacturers, before the date of application of relevant requirements of this Regulation do not need to meet those requirements.

(12)

This Regulation should prevent and reduce adverse impacts of batteries on the environment and ensure a safe and sustainable battery value chain for all batteries, taking into account, for instance, the carbon footprint of battery manufacturing, ethical sourcing of raw materials and security of supply, and facilitating re-use, repurposing and recycling. It should seek to improve the environmental performance of batteries and of the activities of all operators involved in the life cycle of batteries, such as producers, distributors and end-users and, in particular, those operators directly involved in the treatment and recycling of waste batteries. Such measures will help to ensure the transition to a circular economy and the long-term competitiveness of the Union and should contribute to the efficient functioning of the internal market, while taking into account a high level of protection of the environment. This Regulation should also aim to prevent and reduce the adverse impacts of the generation and management of waste batteries on human health and the environment and it should aim to reduce the use of resources and favour the practical application of the waste hierarchy. Thus, to prevent divergences hampering the free circulation of batteries, by laying down uniform obligations and requirements throughout the internal market, Article 114 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU) is the appropriate legal basis for this Regulation. To the extent that this Regulation contains specific rules on the management of waste batteries, the appropriate legal basis, in so far as those specific rules are concerned, is Article 192(1) TFEU.

(13)

Products placed on the market as battery packs, which are batteries or groups of cells that are connected or encapsulated within an outer casing to form a complete unit ready for use by end-users or in applications that the end-user is not intended to split up or open and which conform to the definition of batteries, or battery cells that conform to the definition of batteries, should be subject to requirements applicable to batteries.

(14)

Batteries that can be made ready for use by the end-user with commonly available tools by using a ‘Do It Yourself’ kit, should be considered to be batteries for the purposes of this Regulation. The economic operator placing such kits on the market should be subject to this Regulation.

(15)

Within the broad scope of this Regulation, it is appropriate to distinguish between different categories of batteries in accordance with their design and use, independently of their battery chemistry. The classification into portable batteries, on the one hand, and industrial batteries and automotive batteries on the other hand under Directive 2006/66/EC should be further developed to better reflect new developments in the use of batteries. Batteries that are used for traction in electric vehicles and which, under Directive 2006/66/EC, fall under the category of industrial batteries, constitute a large and growing part of the market due to the quick growth of electric road transport vehicles. It is therefore appropriate to classify those batteries that are used for traction in road vehicles as a new separate category of electric vehicle batteries. Batteries used for traction in light means of transport, such as e-bikes and e-scooters, were not classified as a separate category of battery under Directive 2006/66/EC. However, such batteries constitute a significant part of the market due to their growing use in urban sustainable mobility. It is therefore appropriate to classify those batteries as a new separate category of batteries, namely light means of transport batteries (LMT batteries). Batteries used for traction in other transport vehicles including rail, waterborne and aviation transport or off-road machinery, continue to fall under the category of industrial batteries under this Regulation. The industrial battery category encompasses a broad group of batteries, intended to be used for industrial activities, communication infrastructure, agricultural activities, or generation and distribution of electric energy. Batteries which are given industrial uses after being subject to preparation for repurposing or repurposing, even though they were initially designed for a different use, should be considered to be industrial batteries under this Regulation. In addition to this non exhaustive list of examples, any battery that weighs more than 5 kg that does not fall under any other categories under this Regulation should be considered to be an industrial battery. Batteries used for energy storage in private or domestic environments, should be considered to be industrial batteries for the purposes of this Regulation. Batteries used for traction in wheeled vehicles considered to be toys within the meaning of Directive 2009/48/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council (4), should, for the purposes of this Regulation, not be considered to be LMT batteries, but to be portable batteries.

(16)

After being placed on the market or put into service within the Union for the first time, a battery can be subject to re-use, repurposing, remanufacturing, preparation for re-use or preparation for repurposing. For the purposes of this Regulation, in accordance with the Union framework on product regulation, a used battery, meaning a battery that has been subject to re-use, is considered to have already been placed on the market when it was first made available on the market for use or distribution. Conversely, batteries that have been subject to preparation for re-use, preparation for repurposing, repurposing or remanufacturing, are considered to be placed on the market anew and should therefore comply with this Regulation. In addition, in accordance with the Union framework on product regulation, a used battery that has been imported from a third country is considered to be placed on the market when it enters the Union for the first time. Therefore, a battery that has been subject to re-use, repurposing, remanufacturing, preparation for re-use or preparation for repurposing and that has been imported from a third country should comply with this Regulation.

(17)

Remanufacturing covers a wide range of technical operations that can be carried out on batteries or on waste batteries. As regards waste batteries, remanufacturing can be considered to be preparation for re-use or preparation for repurposing. For that reason, it is not necessary to provide in this Regulation a specific regime for the remanufacturing of waste batteries that is different from the regime on preparation for re-use or preparation for repurposing of waste batteries. As regards used batteries, remanufacturing has the objective of restoring the original performance of a battery. In that sense remanufacturing can be seen as an extreme case of re-use entailing the disassembly and evaluation of the cells and modules of the battery and the replacement of a certain amount of these cells and modules. In order to differentiate remanufacturing from mere re-use, the restoration of the battery capacity to at least 90 % of the original rated battery capacity should be considered to be remanufacturing and necessitates the application of a specific regime.

(18)

Where the end-user is a consumer, and the battery has been subject to preparation for re-use, preparation for repurposing, repurposing or remanufacturing, that battery should be covered by a sales contract that complies with Directive (EU) 2019/771 of the European Parliament and of the Council (5). In particular, the requirements of that Directive cover conformity of the product, liability of the seller, including the option of a shorter liability or limitation period, burden of proof, remedies for lack of conformity, repair or replacement of the goods, and commercial guarantees.

(19)

Batteries should be designed and manufactured to optimise their performance, durability and safety and to minimise their environmental footprint. It is appropriate to lay down specific sustainability requirements for rechargeable industrial batteries with a capacity greater than 2 kWh, LMT batteries and electric vehicle batteries, as such batteries represent the market segment which is expected to increase the most in the coming years.

(20)

For the safety of electric vehicle batteries and starting, lighting and ignition batteries (SLI batteries), the continued validity of the EU type-approval for vehicles of categories M, N and O in accordance with Regulation (EU) 2018/858 of the European Parliament and of the Council (6) requires that any battery which has been repaired or exchanged continues to comply with the applicable safety requirements. Where safety particulars have changed, further inspections or tests are required to verify continued compliance with the requirements upon which the existing EU type-approval has been based.

(21)

In line with the Communication of the Commission of 12 May 2021 on ‘Pathway to a Healthy Planet for All – EU Action Plan: “Towards Zero Pollution for Air, Water and Soil” ’, Union policies should be based on the principle that preventive action should be taken at source. In its Communication of 14 October 2020 on ‘Chemicals Strategy for Sustainability – Towards a Toxic-Free Environment’ (the ‘Chemicals Strategy for Sustainability’), the Commission underlines that the Regulation (EC) No 1907/2006 of the European Parliament and of the Council (7) and Regulation (EC) No 1272/2008 of the European Parliament and of the Council (8) should be reinforced as the Union’s cornerstones for regulating chemicals in the Union and that they should be complemented by coherent approaches to assess and manage chemicals in existing sectorial legislation. The use of hazardous substances in batteries should therefore primarily be restricted at source in order to protect human health and the environment and to manage the presence of such substances in waste. This Regulation should complement the Regulation (EC) No 1907/2006 and Regulation (EC) No 1272/2008 and allow the adoption of risk management measures related to substances including the waste phase.

(22)

In addition to the restrictions set out in Annex XVII to Regulation (EC) No 1907/2006, it is appropriate to set out restrictions for the presence of mercury, cadmium and lead in certain categories of batteries. Batteries used in vehicles which benefit from an exemption under Annex II to Directive 2000/53/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council (9) should be excluded from the prohibition to contain cadmium. With a view to further restrictions on substances present in batteries or used in their manufacturing, it is appropriate to carry out a mapping of substances of concern, defined in the Chemicals Strategy for Sustainability as substances having a chronic effect for human health or the environment, such as substances in the candidate list for eventual inclusion in Annex XIV to Regulation (EC) No 1907/2006 and in Annex VI to Regulation (EC) No 1272/2008, but also those which hamper recycling for safe and high quality secondary raw materials, in the context of the substance evaluation planned in the REACH Evaluation Joint Action Plan published on the website of the European Chemicals Agency set up under Regulation (EC) No 1907/2006 (‘the Agency’).

(23)

In order to ensure that substances that pose an unacceptable risk to human health or to the environment when used in batteries or present in waste batteries, can be duly addressed, the power to adopt acts in accordance with Article 290 TFEU should be delegated to the Commission in respect of amending restrictions on substances in batteries.

(24)

The assessment procedure for adopting new and amending current restrictions on substances in batteries and waste batteries should be fully streamlined with Regulation (EC) No 1907/2006. To ensure effective decision-making, coordination and management of the related technical, scientific and administrative aspects of this Regulation, the Agency should carry out specified tasks with regard to the evaluation of risks from substances in the manufacture and use of batteries, as well as those that may occur after their end-of-life as well as the evaluation of the socioeconomic elements and the analysis of alternatives, in accordance with relevant guidance by the Agency. Consequently, the Committees for Risk Assessment and Socioeconomic Analysis of the Agency should facilitate the carrying out of certain tasks conferred on the Agency by this Regulation.

(25)

In order to ensure that this Regulation is coherent with any future amendment of Regulation (EC) No 1907/2006 or of other future Union law concerning sustainability criteria for hazardous substances and chemicals, the Commission should assess whether an amendment of Articles 6, 86, 87 and 88 of this Regulation is required. Where appropriate, the Commission should propose amendments to this Regulation in a future regulation amending Regulation (EC) No 1907/2006 or in other future Union law concerning sustainably criteria for hazardous substances and chemicals.

(26)

In order to promote a sustainable European economic model, the Commission should, where appropriate, propose amendments to the provisions of this Regulation regulating the restrictions on substances in batteries and in waste batteries, including the introduction of an export ban on batteries that are not compliant with those restrictions.

(27)

The expected massive deployment of batteries in sectors like mobility and energy storage should reduce carbon emissions. However, to maximise that potential, it is necessary that their overall life cycle have a low carbon footprint. According to the Product Environmental Footprint Category Rules for High Specific Energy Rechargeable Batteries for Mobile Applications, climate change is the second highest related impact category for batteries after the mining and use of minerals and metals. Rechargeable industrial batteries with a capacity greater than 2 kWh, LMT batteries and electric vehicle batteries placed on the Union market should therefore be accompanied by a carbon footprint declaration. Harmonising the technical rules for calculating the carbon footprint for all rechargeable industrial batteries with a capacity greater than 2 kWh, LMT batteries and electric vehicle batteries placed on the Union market is a prerequisite for introducing a requirement for a carbon footprint declaration and subsequently for establishing carbon footprint performance classes that will enable batteries with lower overall carbon footprints to be identified. Information and clear labelling requirements on the carbon footprint of batteries is not expected in itself to lead to the behavioural change necessary to ensure that the Union’s objective to decarbonise the mobility and energy storage sectors is achieved, in line with the internationally agreed objectives on climate change. Therefore, maximum carbon thresholds should be introduced, further to a dedicated impact assessment to determine those values. In proposing the level of the maximum carbon footprint threshold, the Commission should, inter alia, take into account the relative distribution of the carbon footprint values in batteries on the market, the extent of progress in the reduction of carbon footprint of batteries placed on the Union market and the effective and potential contribution of this measure to the Union’s objectives on sustainable mobility and climate neutrality by 2050 at the latest. In order to bring about transparency on the batteries’ carbon footprint, and shift the Union market towards batteries with a lower carbon footprint, regardless of where they are produced, a gradual and cumulative increase in the carbon footprint requirements is justified. As a result of these requirements, the avoided carbon emissions in batteries’ life cycle, will contribute to the Union’s climate objectives, particularly that of reaching climate neutrality by 2050 at the latest. This could also contribute to other policies at Union and national level, such as by means of incentives or green public procurement criteria, fostering the production of batteries with lower environmental impacts.

(28)

The maximum life cycle carbon footprint thresholds should be future-proof. Therefore, when adopting a delegated act determining the maximum life cycle carbon footprint threshold, the Commission should take into account the best available manufacturing and production processes and ensure that the technical criteria it selects are consistent with the objective of this Regulation of ensuring that batteries placed on the Union market guarantee a high level of protection of human health, safety of persons, and of property and the environment.

(29)

Certain substances present in batteries, such as cobalt, lead, lithium or nickel, are acquired from scarce resources which are not easily available in the Union, and some are considered critical raw materials by the Commission. In line with the communication of the Commission of 5 May 2021 on ‘Updating the 2020 New Industrial Strategy: Building a stronger Single Market for Europe’s recovery’, the Union needs to enhance its strategic autonomy and increase its resilience in preparation for potential disruptions in supply due to health or other crises. Enhancing circularity and resource efficiency with increased recycling and recovery of those raw materials, will contribute to reaching that goal.

(30)

The increased use of recovered raw materials would support the development of the circular economy and allow a more resource-efficient use of raw materials, while reducing Union dependency on raw materials from third countries. For batteries, this is particularly relevant for cobalt, lead, lithium and nickel. Therefore, it is necessary to promote the recovery of such materials from waste, by establishing a requirement for the level of recycled content in batteries using cobalt, lead, lithium and nickel in active materials. This Regulation should therefore set mandatory recycled content targets for cobalt, lead, lithium and nickel, which should be met by 2031. For cobalt, lithium and nickel, increased targets should be established by 2036. All targets should take into account the availability of waste from which such materials can be recovered, the technical feasibility of the recovery and manufacture processes involved, as well as the time needed by the economic operators to adapt their supply and manufacturing processes. Therefore, before such mandatory targets become applicable, the requirement related to recycled content should be limited to disclosure of information on recycled content. Battery manufacturing waste is likely to be the main source of secondary raw materials for battery manufacturing due to the increase in the production of batteries and should be subject to the same recycling processes as post-consumer waste. Therefore, battery manufacturing waste should be counted as part of the recycled content targets with the objective of accelerating the development of the necessary recycling infrastructure. However, by-products of battery manufacturing that are re-used in the production process, such as manufacturing scrap, do not constitute waste and should therefore not be counted as part of the recycled content targets.

(31)

In order to take into account the risk of short supply of cobalt, lead, lithium and nickel and to assess the availability of those raw materials, the power to adopt acts in accordance with Article 290 TFEU should be delegated to the Commission in respect of amending the targets for the minimum share of recycled cobalt, lead, lithium or nickel present in active materials in batteries.

(32)

In order to take into account changes in battery technologies, which impact the types of materials that can be recovered, the power to adopt acts in accordance with Article 290 TFEU should be delegated to the Commission to supplement this Regulation by inserting further raw materials and respective targets in the list of minimum shares of recycled content present in active materials in batteries.

(33)

In order to ensure that the calculations and verifications of the percentage share of cobalt, lead, lithium and nickel recovered are accurate and reliable and ensure that there is greater legal certainty, the power to adopt acts in accordance with Article 290 TFEU should be delegated to the Commission to supplement this Regulation by establishing the methodology for the calculation and verification of the percentage share of cobalt, lithium or nickel that is present in active materials and that has been recovered from battery manufacturing waste or post-consumer waste and the percentage share of lead that is present in the battery and that has been recovered from waste and the format for the technical documentation on those percentage shares, for each battery model per year and per manufacturing plant. The reutilisation of materials, such as rework, regrind or scrap generated in the battery manufacturing process, which can be reclaimed within the same process that generated the material, should be excluded from that methodology.

(34)

Batteries placed on the Union market should be durable and of high performance. It is therefore necessary to set out performance and durability parameters for portable batteries of general use as well as for rechargeable industrial batteries, LMT batteries and electric vehicle batteries. For electric vehicle batteries, the informal UNECE Working Group on Electric Vehicles and the Environment has developed in-vehicle durability requirements that are to apply in the Union through a future regulation on type-approval of motor vehicles and engines and of systems, components and separate technical units intended for such vehicles, with respect to their emissions and battery durability (Euro 7) (‘Euro 7 Regulation’). Therefore this Regulation should only set information requirements for the performance and durability of electric vehicle batteries. On the other hand, in the area of batteries for energy storage, existing measurement methods to test battery performance and durability are not considered to be sufficiently precise and representative to enable introducing minimum requirements. The introduction of minimum requirements related to performance and durability of these batteries should be accompanied by available adequate harmonised standards or common specifications.

(35)

In order to reduce the life cycle environmental impact of batteries, the power to adopt acts in accordance with Article 290 TFEU should be delegated to the Commission in respect of amending the performance and durability parameters for portable batteries of general use and for rechargeable industrial batteries and establishing minimum values for those parameters. Those delegated acts should also establish how those minimum values are to apply to batteries that have been subject to remanufacturing.

(36)

In order to ensure that the Union’s rules on electrochemical performance and durability for electric vehicle batteries are consistent with the technical specifications of the informal UNECE Working Group on Electric Vehicles and the Environment and in view of technical and scientific progress, the power to adopt acts in accordance with Article 290 TFEU should be delegated to the Commission in respect of amending the performance and durability parameters for electric vehicle batteries. For the minimum values of those parameters for electric vehicle batteries that are incorporated in motor vehicles, it is appropriate to set minimum performance requirements through a future Euro 7 Regulation, based on the minimum performance requirements set out in United Nations (UN) Global Technical Regulation No 22 on in-vehicle battery durability for electrified vehicles.

(37)

Some non-rechargeable batteries of general use can be inefficient in terms of use of resources and energy. Objective requirements regarding the performance and durability of such batteries should be established in order to ensure that fewer low performing non-rechargeable portable batteries of general use are placed on the market, in particular, where, based on a life cycle assessment, the alternative use of rechargeable batteries would result in overall environmental benefits. For batteries that are incorporated in mobile phones and tablets it is appropriate to set performance and durability requirements regarding those batteries through a future eco-design regulation addressing phones and tablets and to update Commission Regulation (EU) No 617/2013 (10) on computers and computer servers. For other portable batteries that are incorporated in other appliances, such as gardening tools or cordless power tools, the possibility of setting minimum performance and durability requirements should be addressed in relevant product legal acts, such as implementing acts under Directive 2009/125/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council (11), or in other Union legal act.

(38)

In order to ensure that portable batteries that were incorporated into appliances are subject to separate collection, treatment and high quality recycling once those appliances become waste, provisions to ensure the removability and replaceability of batteries in such appliances are necessary. Consumer safety should be ensured, in line with Union law and in particular Union safety standards, during the removal of portable batteries from or the replacement of portable batteries in an appliance. A portable battery should be considered to be removable by the end-user when it can be removed with the use of commercially available tools and without requiring the use of specialised tools, unless they are provided free of charge, or proprietary tools, thermal energy or solvents to disassemble it. Commercially available tools are considered to be tools available on the market to all end-users without the need for them to provide evidence of any proprietary rights and that can be used with no restriction, except health and safety-related restrictions. The general provisions of this Regulation should apply without prejudice to the safety and maintenance requirements for professional medical imaging and radiotherapy devices as defined in Regulation (EU) 2017/745 of the European Parliament and of the Council (12) and for in vitro diagnostic medical devices as defined in Regulation (EU) 2017/746 of the European Parliament and of the Council (13), and could be complemented with requirements laid down for particular products powered by batteries under implementing measures under Directive 2009/125/EC. Where other Union law lays down more specific requirements, for safety reasons, regarding the removal of batteries from products, such as toys, those specific rules should apply.

(39)

To ensure the safety of end-users, this Regulation should provide for a limited derogation for portable batteries from the removability and replaceability requirements set for portable batteries concerning appliances that incorporate portable batteries and that are specifically designed to be used, for the majority of the active service of the appliance, in an environment that is regularly subject to splashing water, water streams or water immersion and that are intended to be washable or rinseable. This derogation should only apply when it is not possible, by way of redesign of the appliance, to ensure the safety of the end-user and the safe continued use of the appliance after the end-user has correctly followed the instructions to remove and replace the battery. Where the derogation applies, the product should be designed in such a way as to make the battery removable and replaceable only by independent professionals, and not by end-users.

(40)

For repaired electric vehicle batteries and SLI batteries, the safety requirements of Regulation (EU) 2019/2144 of the European Parliament and of the Council (14) apply to type-approved vehicles of categories M, N and O and batteries designed and constructed for those vehicles. It is important that the safety of such batteries when repaired can be assessed based on non-destructive tests adapted to them. For repaired LMT batteries, the Commission will prepare rules on the safety of micromobility devices, building on experience at national and local levels of safety requirements, as announced in the communication of the Commission of 14 December 2021 on ‘The new EU Urban Mobility Framework’. For other repaired batteries intended for consumers or likely to be used by them, the requirements of Directive 2001/95/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council (15) apply.

(41)

The interoperability of chargers for specific categories of batteries could reduce unnecessary waste and costs for the benefit of consumers and other end-users. It should be possible therefore to recharge LMT batteries and rechargeable batteries that are incorporated into specific categories of electrical and electronic equipment, by making use of common chargers that allow interoperability within each category of batteries. This Regulation should therefore require the Commission to assess how to introduce harmonised standards for common chargers for those categories of batteries, excluding charging devices for categories and classes of radio equipment under Directive 2014/53/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council (16).

(42)

SLI batteries and electric vehicle batteries that are incorporated in motor vehicles should be removable and replaceable by independent professionals. It is appropriate to consider revising Directive 2000/53/EC to ensure that those batteries can be removed, replaced and disassembled, including as regards joining, fastening and sealing elements. For the purposes of the design, manufacturing and the repair of SLI batteries and electric vehicle batteries, manufacturers should provide the relevant vehicle on-board diagnostic information and vehicle repair and maintenance information on a non-discriminatory basis to any interested manufacturer, installer or repairer of equipment for vehicles of categories M, N and O, as provided for in Regulation (EU) 2018/858. Furthermore, the Commission should encourage the development of standards for design and assembly techniques that facilitate the maintenance, repair and repurposing of batteries and battery packs.

(43)

Reliable batteries are fundamental for the operation and safety of many products, appliances and services. Therefore, batteries should be designed and manufactured to ensure they pose no risk to human health or the safety of persons, to property or the environment. This is particularly relevant for stationary battery energy storage systems, which are currently not covered by other Union law. Parameters to be considered in safety tests should therefore be laid down for those batteries and be complemented by applicable standards of the European standardisation organisations.

(44)

Batteries should be labelled in order to provide end-users with transparent, reliable and clear information about batteries and waste batteries. That information would enable end-users to make informed decisions when buying and discarding batteries and waste operators to appropriately treat waste batteries. Batteries should be labelled with all the necessary information concerning their main characteristics, including their capacity and the amount of certain hazardous substances present. To ensure the availability of information over time, that information should also be made available by means of QR codes which are printed or engraved on batteries or are affixed to the packaging and to the documents accompanying the battery and should respect the guidelines of ISO/IEC Standard 18004:2015. The QR code should give access to a battery’s product passport. Labels and QR codes should be accessible to persons with disabilities, in accordance with Directive (EU) 2019/882 of the European Parliament and of the Council (17).

(45)

The inclusion on the battery label of information about the performance of batteries is essential to ensure that end-users, especially consumers, before making their purchase are appropriately informed and in particular that they have a common basis to compare different batteries. Therefore, non-rechargeable portable batteries should be marked with a label indicating ‘non-rechargeable’ and containing the information on their minimum average duration when used in specific applications. Additionally, it is important to offer guidance to the end-user on how to discard waste batteries in an appropriate way.

(46)

For stationary battery energy storage systems, LMT batteries and electric-vehicle batteries using a battery management system, it should be possible for the end-user or any other third party acting on behalf of that end-user to determine the state of health and expected lifetime of the batteries at any time from the data stored in the battery management system. Read-only access to those data should be provided to the person who purchased the battery or any third party acting on behalf of that person at any time for the purposes of evaluating the residual value of the battery, facilitating the preparation for re-use, preparation for repurposing, repurposing or remanufacturing of the battery or for making the battery available to independent aggregators, as defined in Directive (EU) 2019/944 of the European Parliament and of the Council (18), which operate virtual power plants in electricity grids. Therefore, the data should be up to date. It should be updated at least daily and more frequently where that is required for a specific purpose. Technical specifications that originate from the work of the informal UNECE Working Group on Electric Vehicles and the Environment on data access in electric vehicles should be considered to be a benchmark for the state of health and expected lifetime of electric vehicle batteries. These requirements should apply in addition to Union law on type-approval of vehicles, which is the appropriate legal framework for addressing, inter alia, smart charging functions such as vehicle-to-grid, vehicle-to-load, vehicle-to-vehicle, vehicle-to-powerbank and vehicle-to-building charging.

(47)

A number of product-specific requirements under this Regulation, including on performance, durability, repurposing and safety, should be measured by using reliable, accurate and reproducible methods that take into account the generally recognised state-of-the-art measurements, standards and calculation methodologies. In order to ensure that there are no barriers to trade on the internal market, standards should be harmonised at Union level. Such methods and standards should, to the extent possible, take into account the real-life usage of batteries, reflect the average range of consumer behaviour and be robust in order to deter intentional and unintentional circumvention. Once a reference to such a standard has been published in the Official Journal of the European Union in accordance with Regulation (EU) No 1025/2012 of the European Parliament and of the Council (19), batteries that meet that standard should be presumed to be in conformity with those product-specific requirements under this Regulation, provided that the minimum values established for those product-specific requirements are attained. In order to avoid the duplication of technical specifications on the one hand and to maximise efficiency and to take account of the highest levels of expertise and state-of the art knowledge on the other, the Commission should aim to request one or more European standardisation organisations to draft a standard where there is no standard in existence. In the absence of published standards at the time of the application of product-specific requirements, or in the event of an unsatisfactory response by the relevant European standardisation organisation the Commission should adopt, in exceptional and justified cases and after consultation with the relevant stakeholders, common specifications through implementing acts. The compliance with such specifications should also give rise to the presumption of conformity. In cases where the common specifications are, at a later stage, found to have shortcomings, the Commission should by implementing act amend or repeal the common specifications in question. After the references of harmonised standards are published in the Official Journal of the European Union, any common specification should be repealed within a reasonable period which allows manufacturers to take the changes into account.

(48)

Active involvement in the work of international standardisation committees is an important strategic prerequisite for placing future battery technologies on the market. European involvement in some of those committees has been less effective than it could have been. European involvement should be improved to strengthen the Union’s voice in global standardisation, also with a view to enhance the competitiveness of Union companies, to reduce the Union’s dependencies and to protect the interests, policy objectives and values of the Union. Therefore, the Commission and the Member States should monitor and coordinate the European approach to international standardisation. Harmonised standards that complement the implementation of this Regulation should take into account existing international standards, in particular at IEC and ISO level.

(49)

The Commission should ensure that there is consistency regarding harmonised standards and common specifications under this Regulation, including when reviewing Regulation (EU) No 1025/2012.

(50)

To ensure effective access to information for market surveillance purposes, to adapt to new technologies and to ensure resilience in case of global crises, such as the Covid-19 pandemic, it should be possible to provide information online regarding conformity with all Union acts applicable to batteries in the form of a single EU declaration of conformity.

(51)

Regulation (EC) No 765/2008 of the European Parliament and of the Council (20) lays down rules on the accreditation of conformity assessment bodies, provides a framework for the market surveillance of products and for controls on products from third countries, and lays down the general principles of the CE marking. That Regulation should be applicable to batteries covered by this Regulation in order to ensure that products benefiting from the free movement of goods within the Union fulfil requirements providing a high level of protection of public interests such as human health, safety of persons and the environment.

(52)

In order to enable economic operators to demonstrate and the competent authorities to verify that batteries made available on the market comply with this Regulation, it is necessary to provide for conformity assessment procedures. Decision No 768/2008/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council (21) establishes modules for conformity assessment procedures, ranging from the least to the most stringent depending on the level of risk involved and the level of safety required. In accordance with that Decision, where conformity assessment is required, the procedures to be used for that assessment are to be chosen from among those modules. Robust conformity assessment procedures are needed to ensure that batteries comply with the novel and complex carbon footprint and recycled content requirements and due diligence obligations laid down in this Regulation.

(53)

The CE marking on a battery indicates the conformity of that battery with this Regulation. General principles governing the CE marking and its relationship to other markings are set out in Regulation (EC) No 765/2008. Those principles should apply to the CE marking on batteries. In order to ensure that batteries are stored, used and discarded in a manner which is safe from the point of view of protecting human health and the environment, specific rules governing the affixing of the CE marking for batteries should be laid down.

(54)

The conformity assessment procedures set out in this Regulation require the intervention of conformity assessment bodies. In order to ensure a uniform implementation of the provisions in this Regulation, those bodies should be notified by the Member State authorities to the Commission.

(55)

Due to the novelty and complexity of the sustainability, performance, safety, labelling and information requirements for batteries under this Regulation and in order to ensure a consistent level of quality of conformity assessment of batteries, it is necessary to set requirements for the notifying authorities that are involved in the assessment, notification and monitoring of conformity assessment bodies that have been notified to the Commission, thereby becoming notified bodies. In particular, it should be ensured that the notifying authority is objective and impartial with regard to its activities and has a sufficient number of technically competent members of staff to perform its tasks. Furthermore, notifying authorities should be required to safeguard the confidentiality of the information they obtain, but should nonetheless be able to exchange information on notified bodies with national authorities, the notifying authorities of other Member States and the Commission to ensure consistency in the conformity assessment.

(56)

It is essential that all notified bodies perform their functions to the same level and under conditions of fair competition and autonomy. Therefore, this Regulation should lay down requirements for conformity assessment bodies wishing to be notified in order to carry out conformity assessment activities. Those requirements should continue to apply as a prerequisite for keeping the competence of the notified body up-to-date. To ensure its autonomy, the notified body and the staff it employs should be required to remain independent of economic operators in the battery value chain and from other companies, including business associations and parent companies and subsidiaries. The notified body should be required to provide documentary proof of its independence and provide that documentation to the notifying authority. The notified bodies should ensure rotation of the personnel carrying out different conformity assessment tasks.

(57)

If a conformity assessment body demonstrates conformity of the battery with the criteria laid down in harmonised standards it should be presumed to comply with the corresponding requirements laid down in this Regulation.

(58)

Conformity assessment bodies frequently subcontract parts of their activities linked to the assessment of conformity or have recourse to a subsidiary. Certain activities and decision-making processes, both regarding the conformity assessment of batteries and other activities internal to the notified body, should however be carried out exclusively by the notified body itself, in order to ensure its independence and autonomy. Furthermore, in order to safeguard the level of protection required for batteries to be placed on the Union market, conformity assessment subcontractors and subsidiaries should fulfil the same requirements as notified bodies in relation to the performance of conformity assessment tasks under this Regulation.

(59)

Since the services offered by notified bodies in a Member State might relate to batteries made available on the market throughout the Union, it is appropriate to give the other Member States and the Commission the opportunity to raise objections concerning a notified body. The Commission, during its investigations, can seek the advice of a Union testing facility, designated in accordance with Regulation (EU) 2019/1020 of the European Parliament and of the Council (22). In order to ensure uniform conditions for the implementation of this Regulation, implementing powers should be conferred on the Commission in order to request the notifying authority to take corrective action in case a notified body does not meet or no longer meets the requirements of this Regulation.

(60)

In the interests of facilitating and accelerating the conformity assessment procedure, certification and ultimately market access, and in view of the novelty and complexity of the sustainability, safety, labelling and information requirements for batteries provided for in this Regulation, it is crucial that notified bodies have continuous access to all testing equipment and testing facilities needed and that they apply the procedures without creating an unnecessary burden for economic operators. For the same reasons, and to ensure equal treatment of economic operators, it is necessary that notified bodies apply the conformity assessment procedures consistently.

(61)

Prior to taking a final decision on whether a battery can be granted a conformity certificate, the economic operator that wishes to place a battery on the market should be allowed to submit complementary documentation on the battery once.

(62)

The Commission should enable appropriate coordination and cooperation between notified bodies.

(63)

It is appropriate to lay down the obligations on the economic operators related to the placing on the market or putting into service of batteries. For the purposes of this Regulation the term ‘economic operator’ should be understood to cover the manufacturer, the authorised representative, the importer, the distributor, the fulfilment service provider or any other natural or legal person who is subject to obligations in relation to the manufacture of batteries, making them available or placing them on the market or putting them into service. Batteries, for the purposes of this Regulation, should include batteries that have been subject to preparation for re-use, preparation for repurposing, repurposing or remanufacturing.

(64)

It is appropriate to provide that the requirements for batteries, which are put into service without being placed on the market beforehand, should be the same as for batteries that are placed on the market before being put into service. This concerns for example batteries that the manufacturer uses for its own purposes, or batteries that, because of their characteristics, can only be assembled and tested on-site in their final destination. However, to avoid the need to demonstrate compliance twice for the same product, batteries that are placed on the market should not be subject to the same requirements when they are put into service.

(65)

Economic operators should be responsible for the compliance of batteries with the requirements of this Regulation, in relation to their respective roles in the supply chain, to ensure a high level of protection of public interests such as human health, safety of persons, the protection of property and the environment.

(66)

All economic operators active in the supply and distribution chain should take appropriate measures to ensure that they only make available on the market batteries which are in conformity with this Regulation. It is necessary to provide for a clear and proportionate distribution of obligations which corresponds to the role of each economic operator in the supply and distribution chain.

(67)

The manufacturer, having detailed knowledge of the design and production process, is best placed to carry out the conformity assessment procedure. Conformity assessment should therefore remain the obligation of the manufacturer alone.

(68)

The manufacturer should provide sufficiently detailed information on the intended use of the battery to allow its correct and safe placing on the market, putting into service, use and waste management, including possible repurposing.

(69)

In order to facilitate communication between economic operators, market surveillance authorities and end-users, economic operators should, as part of their contact details, indicate a postal and, if available, email and website address.

(70)

The single market should ensure equal conditions of competition for all economic operators and protection against unfair competition. To that end, strengthened enforcement of Union harmonisation legislation on batteries is necessary. Good cooperation between economic operators and the market surveillance authorities is a key element of such strengthened enforcement, allowing immediate intervention and corrective action. It is important that there be an economic operator established in the Union so that there is someone to whom market surveillance authorities can address requests, including requests for information regarding a battery’s compliance with Union harmonisation legislation, and who can cooperate with market surveillance authorities in making sure that immediate corrective action is taken to remedy instances of non-compliance. The economic operators who should perform those tasks are the manufacturer, or the importer when the manufacturer is not established in the Union, or an authorised representative mandated by the manufacturer for this purpose, or a fulfilment service provider established in the Union for batteries handled by it when no other economic operator is established in the Union.

(71)

It is necessary to ensure that batteries from third countries entering the Union market comply with the requirements of this Regulation, and with other applicable Union law, whether imported on their own or incorporated into or added to products, and, in particular, that appropriate conformity assessment procedures have been carried out by manufacturers with regard to those batteries. Provision should therefore be made for importers to make sure that the batteries they place on the market and put into service comply with the requirements of this Regulation and that the CE marking on batteries and documentation drawn up by manufacturers are available for inspection by the national authorities, whether imported as new or used batteries or batteries that have been subject to preparation for re-use, preparation for repurposing, repurposing or remanufacturing.

(72)

When placing a battery on the market or putting it into service, every importer should indicate on the battery the importer’s name, registered trade name or registered trade mark as well as the postal and, if available, email and website address. Exceptions should be provided for cases where the size of the battery is too small for that information to be affixed to it or where the importer would have to open the packaging in order to affix the importer’s name, registered trade name or registered trade mark and the other contact details. In those exceptional cases, the importer should provide the information in a document accompanying the battery or in another immediately accessible way. Where packaging exists, the importer should indicate the information on that packaging.

(73)

Where a distributor makes a battery available on the market after it has been placed on the market or put into service by the manufacturer or the importer, the distributor should act with due care to ensure that its handling of the battery does not adversely affect its compliance with the requirements of this Regulation.

(74)

Any importer or distributor that places a battery on the market or puts it into service under the importer’s or distributor’s own name or trademark, or modifies a battery in such a way that compliance with the requirements of this Regulation could be affected or modifies the purpose of a battery that is already placed on the market should be considered to be the manufacturer and should assume the obligations of the manufacturer provided for in this Regulation.

(75)

Distributors, importers and fulfilment service providers, being close to the market place, should be involved in market surveillance tasks carried out by the national authorities, and should be ready to participate actively, providing those authorities with all necessary information relating to the battery concerned.

(76)

Ensuring traceability of a battery throughout the whole supply chain helps to make market surveillance simpler and more efficient, and provides transparency to consumers. An efficient traceability system facilitates the market surveillance authorities’ task of tracing economic operators who have placed on the market, made available on the market or put into service non-compliant batteries. Economic operators should therefore be required to keep information on their transactions involving batteries for a certain period, including in electronic form.

The extraction, processing and trading of natural mineral resources is fundamental in providing the necessary raw materials for the production of batteries. Battery manufacturers, regardless of their position or leverage over suppliers and of their geographical location, could inadvertently contribute to adverse impacts in the mineral supply chain. For some raw materials, over half of global production is intended for use in battery applications. For example, over 50 % of the global demand for cobalt and over 60 % of the world’s lithium is used for battery production. About 8 % of global natural graphite production and 6 % of global nickel production goes into battery manufacturing.

(78)

Only a few countries supply the raw materials used in battery manufacture and, in some cases, low standards of governance in those countries can exacerbate environmental and social problems. Both cobalt and nickel mining and refining are connected with a large range of social and environmental issues. While the social and environmental impacts for natural graphite are less severe, the mining of natural graphite can have serious health and environmental impacts since it is mainly carried out by artisanal and small scale operations, mostly in informal settings. This, together with the absence of regularly updated mine closure plans and rehabilitation, can result in the destruction of ecosystems and soils. The expected increase in the use of lithium in battery manufacturing is likely to put additional pressure on extraction and refining operations. It is therefore appropriate that lithium be included in the scope of battery due diligence obligations. The expected massive increase in demand for batteries in the Union should not contribute to an increase of such environmental and social risks.

(79)

Some of the raw materials used in battery manufacturing, such as cobalt, lithium and natural graphite, are considered to be critical raw materials for the Union, as indicated by the Commission in its communication of 3 September 2020 on ‘Critical Raw Materials Resilience: Charting a Path towards greater Security and Sustainability’, and their sustainable sourcing is required for the Union battery ecosystem to perform adequately.

(80)

A number of voluntary efforts from actors in the battery supply chain are already in place in order to encourage adherence to sustainable sourcing practices, including the Initiative for Responsible Mining Assurance, the Responsible Minerals Initiative and the Cobalt Industry Responsible Assessment Framework. However, it is not certain that voluntary efforts to set up due diligence schemes will ensure that all economic operators placing batteries in the Union market abide by the same set of minimum rules.

(81)

In the Union, general requirements on due diligence in relation to certain minerals and metals were introduced by Regulation (EU) 2017/821 of the European Parliament and of the Council (23). That Regulation does not, however, address the minerals and materials used for battery production.

(82)

Therefore, in view of the expected exponential growth in battery demand in the Union, an economic operator that places a battery on the Union market should set up a battery due diligence policy. Requirements therefore should be laid down in this Regulation, in order to address the social and environmental risks inherent in the extraction, processing and trading of certain raw materials and secondary raw materials used for the purposes of battery manufacturing. Such policy should encompass all operators in the supply chain, and their subsidiaries and subcontractors, that extract, process and trade certain raw materials and secondary raw materials.

(83)

When putting in place a risk-based battery due diligence policy, the economic operator should base it on internationally recognised due diligence standards and principles, such as those in the United Nations Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights, the Ten Principles of the United Nations Global Compact, the United Nations Environment programme (UNEP) Guidelines for Social Life Cycle Assessment of Products, the International Labour Organisation (ILO) Tripartite Declaration of Principles concerning Multinational Enterprises and Social Policy, the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises and the OECD Due Diligence Guidance for Responsible Business Conduct. Those standards and principles which each economic operator should tailor to its specific context and circumstances, reflect a common understanding amongst governments and stakeholders. In relation to the extraction, processing and trading of natural mineral resources used for battery production, the OECD Due Diligence Guidance for Responsible Supply Chains of Minerals from Conflict-Affected and High-Risk Areas represents an internationally acknowledged standard addressing the specific risks of gross human rights violations, and a long-standing effort by governments and stakeholders to establish good practice in this area.

(84)

According to the UN, ILO and OECD standards and principles, due diligence is an on-going, proactive and reactive process through which companies can ensure that they respect human rights and the environment and do not contribute to conflict. Risk-based due diligence refers to the steps companies should take to identify, prevent, mitigate and otherwise address adverse impacts associated with their activities or sourcing decisions. Economic operators should hold informed, effective and meaningful consultations with affected communities. A company can assess the risks posed by its activities and relationships and adopt risk-mitigation measures, which can include requiring additional information, negotiating with a view to redressing the situation, or suspending or discontinuing engagement with suppliers, in line with relevant standards provided under national and international law, recommendations on responsible business conduct by international organisations, government-backed tools, private sector voluntary initiatives and a company’s internal policies and systems. This approach also helps to scale the due diligence exercise in proportion to the size of the company’s activities or supply chain relationships.

(85)

While private sector due diligence schemes can support economic operators in fulfilling their battery due diligence obligations in line with the OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises and the United Nations Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights, economic operators should be individually responsible for fulfilment of the due diligence obligations laid down in this Regulation.

(86)

Mandatory battery due diligence policies should be adopted or changed and should address, at least the most prevalent social and environmental risk categories. Such a policy should cover the current and foreseeable impacts on social issues, in particular human rights, human health and safety of persons as well as occupational health and safety, and labour rights, on the one hand, and on the environment, in particular on water use, soil protection, air pollution, climate change and biodiversity, as well as protection of community life, on the other.

(87)

As regards the social risk categories, battery due diligence policies should address the risks in relation to the protection of human rights, including human health, community life, including that of indigenous peoples, the protection of children and gender equality, in line with international human rights law. The battery due diligence policies should include information on how the economic operator has contributed to the prevention of human rights abuses and on the instruments in place within the operator’s business structure to fight corruption and bribery. The battery due diligence policies should also ensure proper implementation of the rules of fundamental conventions of the ILO as listed in Annex I to the ILO Tripartite Declaration of Principles concerning Multinational Enterprises and Social Policy.

(88)

Human rights abuses are common in resource-rich conflict-affected and high-risk areas. Therefore, such areas deserve specific attention in the battery due diligence policy of economic operators. Regulation (EU) 2017/821 includes provisions for an indicative, non-exhaustive, regularly updated list of conflict-affected and high-risk areas. That list is also relevant for the implementation of the battery due diligence provisions of this Regulation.

(89)

As regards the environmental risk categories, the battery due diligence policies should address the risks for the protection of the natural environment and biological diversity, in line with the Convention on Biological Diversity, which includes the consideration of local communities and the protection and the development of those communities. Battery due diligence policies should also address the risks related to climate change, in line with the Paris Agreement (24), adopted on 12 December 2015 under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (the ‘UN Paris Agreement’), as well as environmental risks covered by other international environmental conventions.

(90)

The battery due diligence obligations on the identification and mitigation of social and environmental risks associated with raw materials used in battery manufacturing should contribute to the implementation of UNEP Resolution 4/19 on Mineral Resource Governance, which recognises the important contribution of the mining sector towards the achievement of the 2030 Agenda and the Sustainable Development Goals.

(91)

Other Union legal acts that lay down requirements regarding supply chain due diligence should apply to batteries in so far as there are no specific provisions with the same objective, nature and effect in this Regulation which can be adapted in the light of future legislative amendments. Such legal acts might address the civil liability of companies for damages arising due to their failure to comply with due diligence requirements. Where such legal acts do not or not completely address the civil liability consequences of battery due diligence obligations of this Regulation, it should be possible for them to be addressed by national rules.

(92)

In order to adapt to developments in the battery value chain, including to changes in the scope and nature of the relevant environmental and social risks, as well as to technical and scientific progress in batteries and battery chemistries, the power to adopt acts in accordance with Article 290 TFEU should be delegated to the Commission in respect of amending the list of raw materials and risk categories, the list of international instruments and the battery due diligence obligations.

(93)

In order to establish the equivalence of due diligence schemes that have been developed by governments, industry associations and groupings of interested organisations, implementing powers should be conferred on the Commission.

(94)

In order to enable proper, sound and consistent evaluation of the due diligence schemes, the power to adopt acts in accordance with Article 290 TFEU should be delegated to the Commission to supplement this Regulation by establishing the criteria and the methodology for determining whether the due diligence schemes enable economic operators to fulfil the due diligence requirements of this Regulation.

(95)

Harmonised rules for waste management are necessary to ensure that producers and other economic operators are subject to the same rules across the Member States in the implementation of the extended producer responsibility for batteries and to ensure a high level of protection of human health and the environment across the Union. Extended producer responsibility can contribute to reducing overall resource use, in particular by reducing the generation of waste batteries and the adverse impacts linked to the management of waste batteries. Maximising the separate collection of waste batteries and ensuring that all waste batteries that are collected are recycled through processes that meet common minimum recycling efficiencies is necessary in order to attain high levels of recovery of materials. In its evaluation of Directive 2006/66/EC, the Commission found that one of the shortcomings of that Directive is that its provisions were insufficiently detailed, leading to uneven implementation and creating significant barriers to the functioning of recycling markets and suboptimal levels of recycling. Consequently, more detailed and harmonised rules would avoid distortions of the market for the collection, treatment and recycling of waste batteries and ensure even implementation of the requirements across the Union. It would also result in further harmonisation of the quality of waste management services provided by economic operators and facilitate the functioning of the market for secondary raw materials.

(96)

In order to ensure that the obligations under this Regulation are carried out and to monitor and verify compliance by producers and producer responsibility organisations with this Regulation, it is necessary that Member States designate one or more competent authorities.

(97)

This Regulation builds on the waste management rules and general principles laid down in Directive 2008/98/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council (25), which should be adapted to reflect the specific nature of waste batteries. For the collection of waste batteries to be organised in the most effective way, it is important that it be done both near to the place where the batteries are sold and to the end-user. Waste batteries should be collected separately from other waste streams, such as metals, paper and cardboard, glass, plastics, wood, textiles and bio-waste. Also, it should be possible for waste batteries to be collected both together with waste electrical and electronic equipment and with end-of-life vehicles, by way of national collection schemes set up on the basis of Directive 2012/19/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council (26), and of Directive 2000/53/EC. While Directive 2006/66/EC sets up specific rules for batteries, there is a need for a coherent and complementary approach, building upon and further harmonising existing waste management structures. Consequently, and in order to effectively implement extended producer responsibility related to the waste management, obligations should be laid down with respect to the Member State where batteries are made available on the market for the first time.

(98)

In order to monitor fulfilment by producers of their obligations as regards the waste treatment of batteries made available on the market for the first time within the territory of a Member State, it is necessary that a register be established and managed by the competent authority in each Member State. The information in the register should be accessible to those entities that play a role in monitoring compliance with and enforcement of the extended producer responsibility. It should be possible for that register to be the same as the national register set up pursuant to Directive 2006/66/EC. Producers should be required to register, in order to provide the necessary information to allow the competent authorities to monitor fulfilment by producers of their obligations. Registration requirements should be simplified across the Union.

(99)

In the case of state-run producer responsibility organisations, as there is no represented producer’s mandate, the requirements provided in this Regulation concerning such mandates do not apply.

(100)

In view of the polluter pays principle, it is appropriate to impose obligations on producers as regards the management of waste batteries. In this context, producers should be understood to include any manufacturer, importer or distributor who, irrespective of the selling technique used, including by means of distance contracts as defined in Article 2, point (7), of Directive 2011/83/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council (27), supplies a battery for the first time for distribution or use, including when incorporated into appliances, light means of transport or other vehicles, within the territory of a Member State on a commercial basis.

(101)

Producers should have extended producer responsibility for the management of their batteries at the end-of-life stage. Accordingly, they should finance the costs of collecting, treating and recycling all collected batteries, carrying out compositional surveys of mixed collected municipal waste, reporting on batteries and waste batteries, and of providing information to end-users and waste operators about batteries and appropriate re-use and management of waste batteries. The new rules on extended producer responsibility under this Regulation are intended to ensure a high level of environmental and health protection in the Union by maximising separate collection of waste batteries and ensuring that all collected batteries are recycled through processes that reach high rates of recycling efficiency and recovery of materials in light of technical and scientific progress. The obligations related to extended producer responsibility should apply to all forms of supply, including distance selling. Producers should be able to exercise those obligations collectively, by means of producer responsibility organisations taking responsibility on their behalf. Producers or producer responsibility organisations should be subject to authorisation and they should demonstrate that they have the financial means to cover the costs entailed by the extended producer responsibility. When laying down administrative and procedural rules for authorisation of producers for individual compliance and of producer responsibility organisations for collective compliance, Member States should be able to differentiate processes for individual producers and producer responsibility organisations to limit the administrative burden on individual producers. In this context, it should be possible to consider permits issued in accordance with Directive 2008/98/EC to be an authorisation for the purposes of this Regulation. Where necessary to avoid distortion of the internal market and in order to ensure uniform conditions for the modulation of the financial contributions paid to producer responsibility organisations by producers, implementing powers should be conferred on the Commission. Waste management operators carrying out collection and treatment in accordance with this Regulation should be subject to a selection procedure by producers of the relevant batteries or by producer responsibility organisations acting on their behalf, in accordance with Directive 2008/98/EC. Where waste management operations take place in a Member State other than that in which a battery was made available on the market for the first time, producers should cover the costs incurred by the waste management operators in the Member State where the waste operations take place. In the discussion on possible proposals for Union legislative acts on end-of-life vehicles and waste electrical and electronic equipment, the establishment of a cross-border extended producer responsibility mechanism for waste batteries, including those incorporated into vehicles or appliances, between the relevant actors, should be considered. Furthermore, the adoption of other measures should be considered, such as information management and verification tools, including, as appropriate, authorised representatives for extended producer responsibility, waste management operators, producer responsibility organisations, digital product passports and registers of producers, and national vehicle registration systems when covering electric vehicle batteries.

(102)

Extended producer responsibility should apply also to economic operators placing on the market a battery that results from preparation for re-use, preparation for repurposing, repurposing or remanufacturing operations. Therefore, the economic operator that originally placed the battery on the market should not bear the additional costs that could result from the waste management arising from the subsequent life of that battery. It should be possible for the economic operators subject to extended producer responsibility to establish a cost-sharing mechanism based on the attribution of the actual waste management costs.

(103)

This Regulation is a lex specialis in relation to Directive 2008/98/EC for the extended producer responsibility minimum requirements on collection and recycling targets, distributor take-back and second life. Member States should be required to define the extended producer responsibility provided for in this Regulation, in accordance with Directive 2008/98/EC and national law transposing that Directive. In addition, where this Regulation does not provide for full harmonisation in Chapter VIII, Member States should be able to provide for additional measures on those specific topics, provided such further regulation is in accordance with Directive 2008/98/EC and consistent both with national law transposing that Directive and with this Regulation.

(104)

This Regulation should specify how the traceability of traders’ obligations laid down in Regulation (EU) 2022/2065 of the European Parliament and of the Council (28) is to be applied to online platforms allowing consumers to conclude distance contracts with producers offering batteries, including batteries that are incorporated in appliances, light means of transport or other vehicles, and to consumers located in the Union in relation to the registers of producers established pursuant to this Regulation. For the purposes of this Regulation, any producer offering batteries, including those incorporated in appliances, light means of transport or other vehicles, by means of distance contracts directly to consumers located in a Member State, whether established in a Member State or a third country, should be considered to be a trader as defined in Regulation (EU) 2022/2065. Pursuant to that Regulation, providers of online platforms, falling within the scope of Section 4 of Chapter III thereof and who allow consumers to conclude distance contracts with producers, should obtain from those producers information on the register of producers where they are registered as well as their registration number and a self-certification committing to comply with the extended producer responsibility requirements laid down in this Regulation. The implementation of the rules on the traceability of traders for the sale of batteries online are subject to the enforcement rules laid down in Regulation (EU) 2022/2065.

(105)

In order to ensure high quality recycling in the battery supply chain, boost the uptake of quality secondary raw materials and protect the environment, there should be high rates of waste battery collection and recycling. The collection of waste batteries is a fundamental crucial step in the recovery of valuable materials present in batteries through their recycling and in keeping the battery supply chain in the Union, boosting the Union’s strategic autonomy in this sector. Such recycling thus also facilitates access to materials recovered that can be used to manufacture new products.

(106)

Producers should be responsible for financing and organising the separate collection of waste batteries. They should do so by establishing a take-back and collection network and related information campaigns that cover the whole territory of each Member State. Such networks should be close to the end-user and should not only target areas and batteries where collection of waste batteries is profitable. The collection network should include distributors, authorised treatment facilities for waste electrical and electronic equipment and end-of-life vehicles and civic amenity sites, and, on a voluntary basis other actors, such as public authorities and schools. In order to verify and improve the effectiveness of the collection network and related information campaigns, regular compositional surveys at least at NUTS 2 level, which is provided for in Regulation (EC) No 1059/2003 of the European Parliament and of the Council (29) should be carried out on mixed municipal waste and waste electrical and electronic equipment collected to determine the amount of waste portable batteries therein.

(107)

It should be possible for waste batteries to be collected together with waste electrical and electronic equipment, by way of national collection schemes set up on the basis of Directive 2012/19/EU and with end-of-life vehicles in accordance with Directive 2000/53/EC. In such cases, as an obligatory minimum treatment requirement, batteries should be removed from the collected waste appliances and end-of-life vehicles. After having been removed from the collected waste appliances and end-of-life vehicles, batteries should be subject to the requirements of this Regulation. In particular, such waste batteries should be counted towards the attainment of the collection target for that category of battery and be subject to the treatment and recycling requirements laid down in this Regulation.

(108)

Considering the environmental impact and the loss of materials due to waste batteries not being separately collected, and consequently not being treated in an environmentally sound way, the collection target for waste portable batteries established under Directive 2006/66/EC should continue to apply and should be gradually increased. In view of the current increase in sales of LMT batteries and the fact that they have a longer lifetime than portable batteries, it is appropriate to set a specific collection target for waste LMT batteries, separate from the collection target applicable to waste portable batteries. Due to the expected development of the market for LMT batteries and portable batteries and increase in their expected lifetime, the methodology for calculating and verifying collection targets should be reviewed in order to better ascertain the actual volume of waste LMT batteries and waste portable batteries available for collection. Therefore, the power to adopt acts in accordance with Article 290 TFEU should be delegated to the Commission in respect of amending such methodology and of amending the collection targets accordingly. It is crucial that a new ‘Available for collection’ methodology maintains or increases the level of environmental ambition with regard to the collection of waste LMT batteries and waste portable batteries compared to the existing methodology. Based on a Joint Research Centre study on alternative collection targets for waste portable and light means of transport batteries, it is estimated that a collection target for waste LMT batteries of 51 % by 31 December 2028 and 61 % by 31 December 2031, calculated on the basis of the quantities of LMT batteries made available on the market in a Member State, will correspond to a collection target for waste LMT batteries of 79 % by 31 December 2028 and 85 % by 31 December 2031, calculated on the basis of the quantities of LMT batteries available for collection in a Member State. The collection targets for waste portable batteries and waste LMT batteries should be reviewed. It should be possible for such review to also address the possibility of adding two sub-categories of portable batteries: rechargeable and non-rechargeable, with separate collection rates. The Commission should prepare a report to accompany those reviews.

(109)

In order to maximise collection and reduce safety risks, the Commission should assess the feasibility and potential benefits of establishing a deposit return system for batteries, in particular for portable batteries of general use. National and harmonised Union-wide deposit return systems should be taken into account in that assessment.

(110)

The collection rate of waste portable batteries should continue to be calculated on the basis of average annual sales in the preceding years to have targets proportionate to the level of battery consumption in a Member State. In order to best reflect changes in what is comprised in the portable batteries category, as well as in the lifetime and consumption patterns of batteries, the power to adopt acts in accordance with Article 290 TFEU should be delegated to the Commission to amend the methodology for calculation and verification of the collection rate for waste portable batteries, as well as for waste LMT batteries.

(111)

The obligation on Member States to adopt measures concerning the achievement by producers and, where appointed, producer responsibility organisations, of collection targets for waste portable batteries and waste LMT batteries, reflects the general principle that Member States are to ensure the effectiveness of Union law.

(112)

All waste SLI batteries, waste industrial batteries and waste electric vehicles batteries should be collected. For that purpose the producers of SLI batteries, industrial batteries and electric vehicle batteries should be required to accept and take back free of charge, all waste batteries for their respective category from end-users. Detailed reporting obligations should be established for all producers, waste management operators and waste holders involved in the collection of waste SLI batteries, waste industrial batteries and waste electric vehicles batteries.

(113)

In view of the waste hierarchy as established by Directive 2008/98/EC which prioritises prevention, preparation for re-use and recycling and in line with Directive 2008/98/EC and Council Directive 1999/31/EC (30), waste batteries collected should not be disposed of or be subject to an energy recovery operation.

(114)

Any permitted facility carrying out treatment of batteries should comply with minimum requirements to prevent adverse impacts on the environment and human health and to allow a high degree of recovery of materials present in batteries. Directive 2010/75/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council (31) regulates a number of industrial activities involved in the treatment of waste batteries, for which it provides for specific authorisation requirements and controls reflecting best available techniques. Where industrial activities relating to the treatment and recycling of batteries are not covered by Directive 2010/75/EU, operators should in any case be obliged to apply best available techniques, defined in Article 3, point (10), of that Directive, and the specific requirements laid down in this Regulation. The requirements in this Regulation regarding the treatment and recycling of batteries should, where relevant, be adapted by the Commission in the light of scientific and technical progress and emerging new technologies in waste management. Therefore, the power to adopt acts in accordance with Article 290 TFEU should be delegated to the Commission in respect of amending those requirements.

(115)

Targets for the efficiency of the recycling processes and recovery of materials should be established to ensure high quality of recovery of materials for the battery industry, while at the same time ensuring clear and common rules for recyclers and avoiding distortions of competition or other impediments to the smooth functioning of the internal market for secondary raw materials from waste batteries. Targets for recycling efficiency, as a measure of the total amount of materials recycled, should be established for lead-acid batteries, nickel-cadmium batteries, lithium-based batteries and other batteries. Targets for recovery of materials should also be established for cobalt, lead, lithium and nickel, in order to attain a high rate of recovery of materials throughout the Union. The rules on the calculation and reporting on recycling efficiency laid down in Commission Regulation (EU) No 493/2012 (32) should continue to apply. In order to ensure that the calculations and verifications of recycling efficiency and recovery of materials rates are accurate and reliable and ensure that there is greater legal certainty, the power to adopt acts in accordance with Article 290 TFEU should be delegated to the Commission to supplement this Regulation by establishing the methodology for calculation and verification of recycling efficiency and material recovery rates in the recycling processes for batteries and the format for the documentation on recycling efficiency and material recovery for waste batteries and on destination and yield of the final output fractions, in accordance with Part A of Annex XII. The Commission should also review Regulation (EU) No 493/2012 to properly reflect technological developments and changes in industrial recovery processes, to extend their scope to cover existing and new targets, and to provide tools for the characterisation of intermediate products. Treatment facilities should be encouraged to introduce certified environmental management schemes in accordance with Regulation (EC) No 1221/2009 of the European Parliament and of the Council (33).

(116)

It should only be possible to carry out treatment of waste batteries outside the Member State where the waste was collected or outside the Union, where the shipment of waste batteries is in compliance with Regulation (EC) No 1013/2006 of the European Parliament and of the Council (34) and Commission Regulation (EC) No 1418/2007 (35) and where the treatment meets the requirements applicable for this type of waste, according to their classification in Commission Decision 2000/532/EC (36). That Decision should be revised to reflect all battery chemistries, in particular the codes for lithium-based waste batteries, in order to enable proper sorting and reporting of such waste batteries. This Regulation is without prejudice to the possible classification of waste batteries as hazardous waste under Directive 2008/98/EC. Where such treatment takes place outside the Union, in order to be counted towards the recycling efficiencies and targets, the waste management operator on whose behalf it is carried out should be obliged to report on that treatment to the competent authority of the Member State in which those waste batteries were collected and to prove that the treatment took place in conditions that are equivalent to those required under this Regulation and in line with other Union law regarding human health and environmental protection. In order to lay down what are the requirements for such treatment to be considered equivalent, the power to adopt acts in accordance with Article 290 TFEU should be delegated to the Commission to supplement this Regulation by laying down detailed rules containing criteria for the assessment of equivalent conditions.

(117)

In the event waste batteries are exported from the Union for preparation for re-use, preparation for repurposing, or recycling, Member States’ competent authorities should make effective use of the powers provided for in Regulation (EC) No 1013/2006 to require documentary evidence to ascertain compliance with the requirements laid down in this Regulation.

(118)

It should be possible for industrial batteries and electric vehicle batteries that are no longer fit for the original purpose for which they were manufactured to be used for a different purpose as stationary energy storage batteries. A market for used industrial batteries and used electric vehicle batteries is emerging and in order to support the practical application of the waste hierarchy, specific rules should thus be established to allow responsible repurposing of used batteries while taking into account the precautionary principle and ensuring safety of use for end-users. Any such used battery should undergo an assessment of its state of health and available capacity to ascertain its suitability for a purpose other than its original purpose. Batteries that are found to be suitable for a purpose other than their original purpose should ideally be repurposed. In order to ensure uniform conditions for the implementation of requirements that waste industrial batteries, waste LMT batteries or waste electric vehicle batteries should fulfil to cease to be waste, implementing powers should be conferred on the Commission.

(119)

Producers and distributors should be actively involved in providing information to end-users concerning the mandatory separate collection of waste batteries and the availability of collection schemes. They should also inform end-users about the important role end-users have in ensuring the environmentally optimal management of waste batteries. Producers and distributors should make use of up-to-date information technology for the purposes of communicating information to all end-users as well as reporting on batteries. The information should be provided either by classical means, such as outdoor advertising, posters, through social media campaigns, or by more innovative means, such as electronic access to websites provided by QR codes affixed to the battery. Such information should be accessible for persons with disabilities in accordance with Directive (EU) 2019/882.

(120)

To enable the verification of fulfilment of and the effectiveness of the obligations regarding the collection and treatment of waste batteries, it is necessary for operators to report to the competent authorities. Producers of batteries and other waste management operators collecting waste batteries should report for each calendar year, where applicable, the data on batteries sold and waste batteries collected. Regarding treatment, reporting obligations should be imposed upon the waste management operators and recyclers respectively.

(121)

For each calendar year, Member States should provide the Commission with information on the amount of batteries supplied within their territory and the amount of waste batteries collected, by category and chemistry. With regard to waste portable batteries and waste LMT batteries data should be reported separately, allowing the respective collection targets to be adapted, considering the market share of such batteries and their specific purpose and characteristics. Such information should be provided electronically and be accompanied by a quality check report. In order to ensure uniform conditions for the reporting of those data and information to the Commission, as well as for the verification methods, implementing powers should be conferred on the Commission.

(122)

For each calendar year, Member States should report to the Commission the rates for recycling efficiency and recovery of materials achieved taking into account all the individual steps of the recycling process and the output fractions.

(123)

In order to enhance transparency along supply and value chains for all stakeholders, it is necessary to provide for a battery passport that maximises the exchange of information, enables tracking and tracing of batteries and provides information about the carbon intensity of their manufacturing processes as well as the origin of the materials used and whether renewable material, such as material produced from lignin to substitute graphite, is used, about composition of batteries, including raw materials and hazardous chemicals, about repair, repurposing and dismantling operations and possibilities, and about the treatment, recycling and recovery processes to which the batteries could be subject to at the end of their lifetime. The battery passport should provide the public with information about batteries placed on the market and their sustainability requirements. It should provide remanufacturers, second-life operators and recyclers with up-to-date information for the handling of batteries and specific actors with tailored information such as on the state of health of batteries. It should be possible for the battery passport to support market surveillance authorities in carrying out their tasks under this Regulation, but it should not replace or modify the responsibilities of market surveillance authorities, which should, in line with Regulation (EU) 2019/1020, check the information provided in battery passports.

(124)

Certain information in the battery passport should not be public, such as sensitive commercial information to which only a limited number of persons with a legitimate interest would need to have access. This applies to information on dismantling, including safety, and detailed information regarding the composition of the battery, which is essential for repairers, remanufacturers, second-life operators and recyclers. It also applies to information concerning individual batteries, which is essential to those who have purchased the battery or parties acting on their behalf for the purpose of making the battery available to independent energy aggregators or energy market participants, evaluating its residual value or remaining lifetime for further use, and facilitating the preparation for re-use, preparation for repurposing, repurposing or remanufacturing of the battery. Results of test reports should only be accessible to notified bodies, market surveillance authorities and the Commission.

(125)

The battery passport should allow economic operators to gather and re-use in a more efficient way the information and data on individual batteries placed on the market and to make better informed choices in their planning activities. Once the battery is placed on the market it might, in certain cases, be more practical for another legal person, such as a vehicle manufacturer, to update information in the passport. The economic operator that places the battery on the market should therefore be allowed to give written authorisation to any other operator to act on its behalf. The responsibility of compliance with the provisions for the battery passport should lie with the economic operator that places the battery on the market. In order to ensure uniform conditions for the implementation of the battery passport, implementing powers should be conferred on the Commission.

(126)

To ensure that the battery passport is flexible, dynamic and market-driven and evolves in line with business models, markets and innovation, it should be based on a decentralised data system, set up and maintained by economic operators. To ensure the effective roll-out of the battery passport, the technical design, data requirements and operation of the battery passport should adhere to a set of essential technical requirements. Such requirements should be developed hand-in-hand with those for digital product passports required by other Union law concerning eco-design for sustainable products. Technical specifications, for which the Commission’s Connecting Europe Facility principles for the eDelivery Network should be considered, should be established to ensure the effective implementation of those essential requirements, either in the form of harmonised standards for which the references are published in the Official Journal of the European Union or, as a fall-back option, in the form of common specifications adopted by the Commission. The technical design should ensure that the battery passport carries data in a secure way which respects privacy rules.

(127)

Regulation (EU) 2019/1020 lays down the general rules on market surveillance and control of products placed on the Union market or that enter the Union market from third countries. In order to ensure that batteries benefiting from the free movement of goods fulfil requirements providing for a high level of protection of public interests such as human health, safety of persons, protection of property and the environment, and to ensure full enforceability of the obligations, in particular relating to the battery due diligence policies, under this Regulation, Regulation (EU) 2019/1020 should also apply to the batteries and economic operators covered by this Regulation. Therefore, Annex I to Regulation (EU) 2019/1020 should be amended accordingly.

(128)

Regulation (EU) 2019/1020 requires market surveillance authorities to perform appropriate checks on the characteristics of products on an adequate scale. It confers powers on the Commission to adopt implementing acts to determine the uniform conditions for checks, criteria for determination of the frequency of checks and amount of samples to be checked in relation to certain products or categories of products. That conferral of powers also applies to the batteries covered by this Regulation where the conditions specified in Regulation (EU) 2019/1020 are met.

(129)

Regulation (EU) 2019/1020 introduced new instruments to improve compliance and market surveillance, which are also relevant to batteries. It provides for the Commission to designate a public testing facility of a Member State as a Union testing facility for specific categories of products or for specific risks related to a category of products. The Commission is to include the batteries covered by this Regulation in its next call for expression of interest for the designation of Union testing facilities pursuant to Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) 2022/1267 (37). Regulation (EU) 2019/1020 also provides that market surveillance authorities can carry out joint activities with organisations representing economic operators or end-users, with a view to promoting compliance, identifying non-compliance, raising awareness and providing guidance in relation to specific categories of products. That possibility should also be provided in relation to the requirements of this Regulation. In that context, Member States or market surveillance authorities might explore setting up battery competence centres.

(130)

Batteries should be placed on the market only if they do not present a risk to human health, safety of persons, property or the environment when stored and used for their intended purpose, or under conditions of use which can be reasonably foreseen, that is, when such conditions of use could result from lawful and readily predictable human behaviour.

(131)

A procedure should exist under which interested parties are informed of measures intended to be taken with regard to batteries that present a risk to human health, safety of persons, property or the environment. Such a procedure should also allow market surveillance authorities in the Member States, in cooperation with the relevant economic operators, to act at an early stage in respect of such batteries. In order to ensure uniform conditions for the implementation of this Regulation, implementing powers should be conferred on the Commission in order to determine whether national measures in respect of non-compliant batteries are justified or not.

(132)

The market surveillance authorities should be allowed to require an economic operator to take corrective action if they find either that a battery is not compliant with the requirements of this Regulation or that an economic operator has infringed the rules on the placing or making available on the market of a battery, or on sustainability, safety, labelling and information or on supply chain due diligence.

(133)

Public procurement constitutes an important sector with regard to reducing the impacts on the environment of human activities and to stimulating market transformation towards more sustainable products. Contracting authorities, as defined in Directives 2014/24/EU (38) and 2014/25/EU (39) of the European Parliament and of the Council, and contracting entities as defined in Directive 2014/25/EU should take account of the environmental impacts when procuring batteries or products containing batteries and should ensure effective compliance by the economic operators with social and environmental requirements, in order to promote and stimulate the market for clean and energy-efficient mobility and energy-storage and thus contribute to the environment, climate and energy policy objectives of the Union.

(134)

When adopting delegated acts under this Regulation, it is of particular importance that the Commission carry out appropriate consultations during its preparatory work, including at expert level, and that those consultations be conducted in accordance with the principles laid down in the Interinstitutional Agreement of 13 April 2016 on Better Law-Making (40). In particular, to ensure equal participation in the preparation of delegated acts, the European Parliament and the Council receive all documents at the same time as Member States’ experts, and their experts systematically have access to meetings of Commission expert groups dealing with the preparation of delegated acts.

(135)

The implementing powers that are conferred on the Commission by this Regulation should be exercised in accordance with Regulation (EU) No 182/2011 of the European Parliament and of the Council (41).

(136)

The advisory procedure should be used for the adoption of an implementing act in situations where the Commission ascertains that a notified body does not meet the requirements for its notification, in order to request the notifying authority to take the necessary corrective action, including withdrawal of the notification if necessary.

(137)

The Commission should adopt immediately applicable implementing acts determining whether a national measure taken in respect of a compliant battery that presents a risk is justified or not where, in duly justified cases relating to the protection of human health or the safety of persons, or the protection of property or the environment, imperative grounds of urgency so require.

(138)

Member States should lay down rules on penalties applicable to infringements of this Regulation and ensure that those rules are implemented. The penalties provided for should be effective, proportionate and dissuasive. When imposing penalties, it is important that due regard be given to the nature, gravity, scope, intentional nature and repetition of the infringement and the level of cooperation of the natural or legal person held responsible with the competent authority. The imposition of penalties is to comply with Union and national law, including with applicable procedural safeguards and with the principles of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union.

(139)

In view of the need to ensure a high level of environmental protection and the need to take into account new developments based on scientific facts, the Commission should submit to the European Parliament and to the Council a report on the application of this Regulation and its impact on the environment and the functioning of the internal market. The Commission should include, in its report, an evaluation of the provisions on sustainability, safety, labelling and information criteria, the waste batteries management measures and the supply chain due diligence requirements. Where appropriate, the report should be accompanied by a proposal to amend relevant provisions of this Regulation.

(140)

It is necessary to provide for sufficient time for economic operators to fulfil their obligations under this Regulation, and for Member States to set up the administrative infrastructure necessary for its application. The application of this Regulation should therefore also be deferred to a date where those preparations can reasonably be finalised.

(141)

In order to allow Member States to adapt the register of producers set up under Directive 2006/66/EC and to take the necessary administrative measures regarding the organisation of the authorisation procedures by the competent authorities, while keeping continuity for economic operators, Directive 2006/66/EC should be repealed as of 18 August 2025. Obligations under that Directive related to monitoring and reporting the collection rate of portable batteries should remain in force until 31 December 2023, and the related obligations for the transmission of data to the Commission should remain in force until 30 June 2025, obligations under that Directive related to monitoring and reporting the recycling efficiencies of recycling processes should remain in force until 31 December 2025, and the related obligations for the transmission of data to the Commission should remain in force until 30 June 2027, in order to ensure continuity until new calculation rules and reporting formats are adopted by the Commission under this Regulation.

(142)

It is important that, in the implementation of this Regulation, environmental, social and economic impacts be considered. Moreover, in order to ensure that there is a level playing field, it is important that, in the implementation of this Regulation, all relevant available technologies are equally taken into consideration, provided that those technologies allow for full compliance of batteries with any relevant requirement set out in this Regulation. Furthermore, no excessive administrative burden should be imposed on economic operators, in particular on small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs).

(143)

Since the objectives of this Regulation, namely to contribute to the functioning of the internal market and to prevent and reduce the adverse impacts of batteries and waste batteries to ensure a high level of protection of human health, safety of persons, property and the environment, cannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member States but can rather, by reason of the need for harmonisation, be better achieved at Union level, the Union may adopt measures, in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity as set out in Article 5 of the Treaty on European Union. In accordance with the principle of proportionality, as set out in that Article, this Regulation does not go beyond what is necessary in order to achieve those objectives,

HAVE ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:

Article 53

Recognition of due diligence schemes

1.   Governments, industry associations and groupings of interested organisations that have developed and oversee due diligence schemes (‘scheme owners’) may apply to have their due diligence schemes recognised by the Commission. The Commission is empowered to adopt implementing acts establishing the information requirements that the application for recognition is to contain. Those implementing acts shall be adopted in accordance with the examination procedure referred to in Article 90(3).

2.   Where, on the basis of the evidence and information provided pursuant to the paragraph 1 of this Article, the Commission determines that the due diligence scheme referred to in that paragraph, enables economic operators to meet the requirements laid down in Articles 48, 49, 50 and 52, it shall adopt an implementing act granting that scheme a recognition of equivalence with the requirements laid down in this Regulation. The OECD Centre for Responsible Business Conduct shall be consulted prior to the adoption of that implementing act. That implementing act shall be adopted in accordance with the examination procedure referred to in Article 90(3).

When making a determination on the recognition of a due diligence scheme, the Commission shall take into account the diverse industry practices covered by that scheme and shall have regard to the risk-based approach and method used by that scheme to identify risks.

3.   The Commission shall adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 89 setting out the criteria and the methodology according to which the Commission is to determine, in accordance with paragraph 2 of this Article, whether due diligence schemes enable economic operators to meet the requirements laid down in Articles 48, 49, 50 and 52. The Commission shall also, as appropriate, periodically verify that recognised due diligence schemes continue to fulfil the criteria that led to a decision to grant recognition of equivalence pursuant to paragraph 2 of this Article.

4.   The owner of a due diligence scheme for which the recognition of equivalence was granted in accordance with paragraph 2 shall inform the Commission without delay of any changes or updates made to that scheme. The Commission shall assess whether such changes or updates affect the recognition of equivalence of that scheme and take appropriate action.

5.   If there is evidence of repeated or significant cases where economic operators implementing a scheme recognised in accordance with paragraph 2 of this Article have failed to meet the requirements laid down in Articles 48, 49, 50 and 52, the Commission shall examine, in consultation with the owner of the recognised due diligence scheme, whether those cases indicate deficiencies in the scheme.

6.   Where the Commission identifies a failure to comply with the requirements laid down in Articles 48, 49, 50 and 52 or deficiencies in a recognised due diligence scheme, it may grant the scheme owner an appropriate period to take remedial action.

7.   Where the scheme owner fails or refuses to take the necessary remedial action, and where the Commission has determined that the failure or deficiencies referred to in paragraph 6 of this Article compromise the ability of the economic operator referred to in Article 48(1) implementing the scheme to comply with the requirements laid down in Articles 48, 49, 50 and 52 or where repeated or significant cases of non-compliance by economic operators implementing a scheme are due to deficiencies in the scheme, the Commission shall adopt an implementing act withdrawing the recognition of equivalence of the scheme. That implementing act shall be adopted in accordance with the examination procedure referred to in Article 90(3).

8.   The Commission shall establish and keep up-to-date a register of recognised due diligence schemes. That register shall be made publicly available on the internet.

Article 56

Extended Producer Responsibility

1.   Producers shall have extended producer responsibility for batteries that they make available on the market for the first time within the territory of a Member State. Such producers shall comply with the requirements of Articles 8 and 8a of Directive 2008/98/EC and of this Chapter.

2.   An economic operator that makes available on the market for the first time within the territory of a Member State a battery that results from preparation for re-use, preparation for repurposing, repurposing or remanufacturing operations shall be considered to be the producer of such battery for the purposes of this Regulation and shall have extended producer responsibility.

3.   A producer as defined in Article 3, point (47)(d) shall appoint an authorised representative for extended producer responsibility in each Member State in which it sells batteries. Such appointment shall be made by written mandate.

4.   The financial contributions to be paid by the producer shall cover the following costs for the products that the producer makes available on the market in the Member State concerned:

(a)

costs of separate collection of waste batteries and their subsequent transport and treatment, taking into account any revenues obtained from preparation for re-use or preparation for repurposing or from the value of secondary raw materials recovered from recycled waste batteries;

Where a battery referred to in paragraph 2 is subject to more than one extended producer responsibility, the first producer making that battery available on the market shall not bear additional costs as a result of the cost sharing mechanism referred to in the first subparagraph.

The Commission shall facilitate the exchange of information and sharing of best practices among Member States regarding such cost sharing mechanisms.

Article 57

Producer Responsibility Organisation

1.   Producers may appoint a producer responsibility organisation authorised in accordance with Article 58 to fulfil the extended producer responsibility obligations on their behalf. Member States may adopt measures to make the appointment of a producer responsibility organisation mandatory. Such measures shall be justified on the basis of the specific characteristics of a given category of batteries placed on the market and related waste management characteristics.

2.   In the case of a collective fulfilment of extended producer responsibility obligations, producer responsibility organisations shall ensure equal treatment of producers regardless of their origin or size, without placing a disproportionate burden on producers of small quantities of batteries, including small- and medium-sized enterprises. They shall also ensure that the financial contributions paid to them by producers:

(a)

are modulated in accordance with Article 8a(4), point (b), of Directive 2008/98/EC and as a minimum by battery category and battery chemistry, taking into account as appropriate the rechargeability, the level of recycled content in the manufacture of batteries and whether the batteries were subject to preparation for re-use, preparation for repurposing, repurposing or remanufacturing, and their carbon footprint; and

(b)

are adjusted to take account of any revenues obtained by the producer responsibility organisations from preparation for re-use or preparation for repurposing or from the value of secondary raw materials recovered from recycled waste batteries.

3.   Where, in a Member State, multiple producer responsibility organisations are authorised to fulfil extended producer responsibility obligations on behalf of producers, they shall ensure coverage across the whole territory of the Member State of the activities referred to in Article 59(1), Article 60(1) and Article 61(1). Member States shall designate the competent authority or appoint an independent third party to ensure that producer responsibility organisations fulfil their obligations in coordinated manner.

4.   Producer responsibility organisations shall ensure the confidentiality of the data in its possession as regards proprietary information or information directly attributable to individual producers or their authorised representatives for extended producer responsibility.

5.   In addition to the information referred to in Article 8a(3), point (e), of Directive 2008/98/EC, producer responsibility organisations shall publish on their websites at least each year, subject to commercial and industrial confidentiality, the information on the rate of separate collection of waste batteries, recycling efficiencies and the levels of recovery of materials achieved by the producers which appointed the producer responsibility organisation.

6.   In addition to the information referred to in paragraph 5, producer responsibility organisations shall make publicly available information on the selection procedure for waste management operators selected in accordance with paragraph 8.

7.   Where necessary to avoid distortion of the internal market, the Commission is empowered to adopt an implementing act laying down criteria for the application of paragraph 2, point (a), of this Article. That implementing act shall not concern the precise determination of the level of the contributions and shall be adopted in accordance with the examination procedure referred to in Article 90(3).

8.   Waste management operators shall be subject to a non-discriminatory selection procedure, based on transparent award criteria, carried out by producers or producer responsibility organisations and which does not place a disproportionate burden on small- and medium-sized enterprises.

Article 58

Authorisation on fulfilment of extended producer responsibility

1.   A producer, in the case of individual fulfilment of extended producer responsibility obligations, and producer responsibility organisations appointed in the case of collective fulfilment of extended producer responsibility obligations, shall apply for an authorisation on fulfilment of extended producer responsibility from the competent authority.

2.   The authorisation shall be granted only where it is demonstrated:

(a)

that requirements laid down in Article 8a(3), points (a) to (d), of the Directive 2008/98/EC are complied with and the measures put in place by the producer or producer responsibility organisation are sufficient to fulfil the obligations set out in this Chapter with regard to the amount of batteries made available on the market for the first time within the territory of a Member State by the producer or producers on whose behalf the producer responsibility organisation acts; and

(b)

by providing documentary evidence, that the requirements of Article 59(1) and (2) or the requirements of Article 60(1), (2) and (4), are complied with and that all the arrangements are in place to make it possible to attain and maintain durably at least the collection target referred to in Article 59(3) and Article 60(3), respectively.

3.   Member States shall, in their measures laying down administrative and procedural rules referred to in Article 54(3), point (b), include the details of the authorisation procedure, which may differ according to whether it relates to individual or collective fulfilment of the extended producer responsibility obligations, and the modalities for verifying compliance of producers or producer responsibility organisations, including the information to be provided by producers or producer responsibility organisations to that end. The authorisation procedure shall include requirements on the verification of the arrangements put in place to ensure compliance with the requirements laid down in Article 59(1) and (2) and in Article 60(1), (2) and (4), and timeframes for the verification, which shall not exceed 12 weeks from the submission of a complete application dossier. The verification may be carried out by an independent expert, which shall issue a verification report on the result of verification.

4.   The producer or the producer responsibility organisations shall notify the competent authority without undue delay of any changes to the information contained in the authorisation, of any changes that concern the terms of the authorisation or of the permanent cessation of operations.

5.   The self-control mechanism provided for in Article 8a(3), point (d), of Directive 2008/98/EC shall be carried out regularly, and at least every three years, and upon request by the competent authority, in order to verify that the provisions in that point are complied with and the conditions for authorisation referred to in paragraph 2 of this Article continue to be met. The producer or the producer responsibility organisation shall, upon request, present a self-control report and, where necessary, the draft corrective action plan to the competent authority. Without prejudice to the competencies under paragraph 6 of this Article, the competent authority may make observations on the self-control report and on the draft corrective action plan, and shall communicate any such observations to the producer or the producer responsibility organisation.

CARBON FOOTPRINT

1.   Scope

This Annex provides essential elements on how to calculate the carbon footprint.

The methodology for calculation and verification of the carbon footprint to be provided for by means of the delegated act adopted pursuant to Article 7 shall build on the essential elements included in this Annex, be in compliance with the latest version of the Commission Product Environmental Footprint (PEF) method and relevant Product Environmental Footprint Category Rules (PEFCRs) and reflect the international agreements and technical/scientific progress in the area of life cycle assessment.

The calculation of the life cycle carbon footprint shall be based on the bill of materials, the energy and the auxiliary materials used in a specific manufacturing plant to produce a specific battery model. In particular, the electronic components, for example battery management units and safety units, and the cathode materials shall be accurately identified, as they can become the main contributor for the battery carbon footprint.

2.   Definitions

For the purposes of this Annex, the following definitions apply:

(a)

‘activity data’ means the information associated with processes while modelling Life Cycle Inventories (LCI), whereby the aggregated LCI results of the process chains that represent the activities of a process are each multiplied by the corresponding activity data and then combined to derive the carbon footprint associated with that process;

(b)

‘bill of materials’ means a list of the raw materials, sub-assemblies, intermediate assemblies, sub-components and parts, and the quantities of each, needed to manufacture the battery;

(c)

‘company-specific data’ means data that are directly measured or collected from one or multiple facilities (site-specific data) that are representative of the activities of the company, such data are also known as ‘primary data’;

(d)

‘functional unit’ means the qualitative and quantitative aspects of the functions, services, or both, provided by the battery;

(e)

‘life cycle’ means the consecutive and interlinked stages of a product system, from raw material acquisition or generation from natural resources to final disposal (ISO 14040:2006 or an equivalent standard);

(f)

‘life cycle inventory (LCI)’ means the combined set of exchanges of elementary, waste and product flows in an LCI dataset;

(g)

‘life cycle inventory (LCI) dataset’ means a document or file with life cycle information on a specified product or other reference, such as the site or process, covering descriptive metadata and quantitative life cycle inventory, which could include a unit process dataset, partially aggregated or an aggregated dataset;

(h)

‘reference flow’ means the measure of the outputs from processes in a given product system required to fulfil the function expressed by the functional unit (based on ISO 14040:2006 or an equivalent standard);

(i)

‘secondary data’ means data that are not directly collected or measured from a specific process within the supply-chain of the company or estimated by that company, but that are sourced from a third party LCI database or other sources; such data include industry average data, for example from published production data, government statistics, and industry associations, as well as literature studies, engineering studies and patents, and can also be based on financial data, and contain proxy data and other generic data; and also include primary data that go through a horizontal aggregation step;

(j)

‘system boundary’ means the aspects included or excluded from the life cycle stages.

Additionally, the harmonised rules for the calculation of the carbon footprint of batteries shall include any further definition necessary for their interpretation.

3.   Functional unit and reference flow

The functional unit is defined as one kWh (kilowatt-hour) of the total energy provided by the battery system over the battery’s service life, measured in kWh. The total energy is obtained from the number of cycles multiplied by the amount of delivered energy over each cycle.

The reference flow is the weight of battery needed to fulfil a specific function and shall be measured in kg of battery per kWh of the total energy delivered by the battery over its service life. All quantitative input and output data collected by the manufacturer to quantify the carbon footprint shall be calculated in relation to the reference flow.

By way of exception to the first paragraph, for back-up batteries that have as their primary function to ensure continuity of a power source, the functional unit is defined as the ability to provide one kWmin (kilowatt-minute) of backup power capability at any moment over the lifetime of the battery. Accordingly, the reference flow for back-up batteries is the weight of battery needed to fulfil the defined function and shall be measured in kg of battery per kWmin of backup power capability divided by the service life of the battery in years. All quantitative input and output data collected by manufacturers of back-up batteries to quantify the carbon footprint shall be calculated in relation to that reference flow.

In exceptional cases, such as for batteries for hybrid non -plug-in vehicles, the methodology may define a different functional unit.

4.   System boundary

The following life cycle stages and the processes involved therein shall be included in the system boundary:
The following processes involved in the life cycle stages shall be excluded from the system boundary:

—

manufacturing of equipment for the assembly and recycling of batteries, as carbon footprint impacts have been calculated as negligible in the PEFCRs for high specific energy rechargeable batteries for mobile applications;

—

the battery assembly process using the original equipment manufacturer (OEM) system components; this process corresponds for the most part to mechanical assembly and it is included inside the OEM equipment or vehicle assembly line; the consumption of energy and material for this specific process is negligible when compared to the manufacturing process of OEM components.

The use phase shall be excluded from the life cycle carbon footprint calculations, as it is not under the direct influence of manufacturers except where it is demonstrated that choices made by battery manufacturers at the design stage can make a non-negligible contribution to that impact.

5.   Use of company-specific and secondary datasets

Due to the high number of battery components and the complexity of manufacturing processes, the economic operator shall limit, where justified, the use of company specific data to process and component analysis of the battery-specific parts.

In particular, all activity data related to the battery’s anode, cathode, electrolyte, separator and cell-casing shall refer to a specific battery model produced in a specific production plant. Accordingly, no default activity data shall be used. The battery-specific activity data shall be used in combination with the relevant PEF-compliant secondary datasets.

As the carbon footprint declaration is specific to a battery model produced in a defined production site, sampling of data collected from different plants producing the same battery model shall not be allowed.

Where there is a change in the bill of materials or energy mix used to produce a battery model, the carbon footprint for that battery model shall be recalculated.

The harmonised rules to be provided for via a delegated act as referred to in Article 7(1) shall include detailed modelling of the following life cycle stages:

—

raw material acquisition and pre-processing,

—

production,

—

distribution,

—

own electricity production,

—

end of life.

6.   Carbon footprint impact assessment

The carbon footprint of the battery shall be calculated using the ‘climate change’ life cycle impact assessment method recommended in the 2019 Joint Research Centre report entitled ‘Suggestions for updating the Product Environmental Footprint (PEF) method’.

The results shall be provided as characterised results without normalisation and weighting. The list of characterization factors to be used is available at the European Platform on Life Cycle Assessment (LCA).

7.   Offsets

Offsets are calculated relative to a baseline that represents a hypothetical scenario for what emissions would have been in the absence of the mitigation project that generates the offsets.

Offsets shall not be included in the carbon footprint declaration, but may be reported separately as additional environmental information and used for communication purposes.

8.   Carbon footprint performance classes

Depending on the distribution of the values in the carbon footprint declarations of batteries placed on the market, a meaningful number of classes of performance shall be identified, with category A being the best class with the lowest carbon footprint life cycle impact, to enable market differentiation of the battery categories referred to in Article 7(1).

The setting of the threshold for each class of performance, as well as the width of that class, shall be based on the distribution of performances of the battery categories referred to in Article 7(1) placed on the market in the previous three years, the expected technological improvements, and other technical factors.

9.   Maximum carbon thresholds

Based on the information collected through the carbon footprint declarations and the relative distribution of the carbon footprint performance classes of battery models placed on the market, and taking into account the scientific and technical progress in the field, the Commission shall set maximum life cycle carbon footprint thresholds for the battery categories referred to in Article 7(1), after having carried out a dedicated impact assessment to determine the values for the thresholds.

In setting maximum life cycle carbon footprint thresholds referred to in the first subparagraph, the Commission shall take into account the relative distribution of the carbon footprint values for batteries on the market, the extent of progress in reducing the carbon footprint of batteries placed on the market and the actual and potential contribution of those life cycle carbon footprint thresholds to the Union’s objectives on sustainable mobility and climate neutrality by 2050.

ANNEX V

SAFETY PARAMETERS

1.   Thermal shock and cycling

This test shall be designed to evaluate changes in the integrity of the battery arising from expansion and contraction of cell components upon exposure to extreme and sudden changes in temperature, and potential consequences of such changes. During a thermal shock, the battery shall be exposed to two temperature limits and held at each temperature limit for a specified period.

2.   External short circuit protection

This test shall evaluate the safety performance of a battery when applying an external short circuit. The test can evaluate the activation of the overcurrent protection device or the ability of cells to withstand the current without reaching a hazardous situation (e.g. thermal runaway, explosion, fire). The main risk factors are heat generation at cell level and electrical arcing, which can damage circuitry or lead to reduced isolation resistance.

3.   Overcharge protection

This test shall evaluate the safety performance of a battery in overcharge situations. The main safety risks during overcharge are the decomposition of the electrolyte, cathode and anode breakdown, exothermic decomposition of the solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) layer, separator degradation, and lithium plating, which can lead to self-heating of the battery and thermal runaway. The factors affecting the outcome of the test shall, as a minimum, include, the charging rate and the finally reached state of charge. The protection can be ensured either by voltage control (interruption after reaching the limit charging voltage) or current control (interruption after exceeding maximum charging current).

4.   Over-discharge protection

This test shall evaluate the safety performance of a battery in over-discharge situations. Safety risks during over-discharge include polarity reversal leading to oxidation of the anode current collector (Copper) and to plating on the cathode side. Even minor over-discharge can cause dendrite formation and ultimately short-circuiting.

5.   Over-temperature protection

This test shall evaluate the effect of temperature control failure or failure of other features for protection against internal overheating during operation.

6.   Thermal propagation protection

This test shall evaluate the safety performance of a battery in thermal propagation situations. A thermal runaway in one cell can cause a cascading reaction throughout the entire battery which can be composed of numerous cells. It can lead to severe consequences including a significant gas release. The test shall take into account the tests that are under development for transport applications by ISO and the UN Global Technical Regulation.

7.   Mechanical damage by external forces

These tests shall simulate one or more situations in which a battery is accidentally exposed to mechanical stresses and remains operational for the purpose for which it was designed. The criteria to simulate these situations should reflect real life uses.

8.   Internal short circuit

This test shall evaluate the safety performance of a battery in internal short-circuit situations. The occurrence of internal short circuits, one of the main concerns for battery manufacturers, potentially leads to venting, thermal runaway, and sparking which can ignite the electrolyte vapours escaping from the cell. The generation of such internal short circuits can be triggered by manufacturing imperfections, the presence of impurities in the cells or dendritic growth of lithium, and is the cause of most in-field safety incidents. Multiple internal short circuit scenarios are possible (e.g. electrical contact of cathode/anode, aluminium current collector/copper current collector, aluminium current collector/anode) each with a different contact resistance.

9.   Thermal abuse

Having regard to Directive 2006/66/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 6 September 2006 on batteries and accumulators and waste batteries and accumulators and repealing Directive 91/157/EEC (1), and in particular Article 21(2) and 21(7) thereof,

Whereas:

(1)

A reduction in waste quantities could be obtained by increasing the average life span of secondary (rechargeable) batteries. Choosing the appropriate battery for an appliance would reduce the amount of waste batteries and accumulators.

(2)

It is essential that capacity labelling information be provided through harmonised, controllable and repeatable methods in order to ensure fair competition and consistent quality values for manufacturers.

(3)

Directive 2006/66/EC requires that all portable and automotive batteries and accumulators be provided with a capacity label. The capacity label aims at providing useful, easily understandable and comparable information for end-users when purchasing portable and automotive batteries and accumulators.

(4)

Pursuant to Article 21(7) of Directive 2006/66/EC exemptions may be granted from the capacity labelling requirements.

(5)

It is appropriate to grant such exemptions for batteries and accumulators which are sold incorporated in appliances and are not intended to be removed by end-users for safety, performance, medical or data integrity reasons and continuity of power supply. These batteries and accumulators are not accessible to end-users and therefore the end-users do not have to make a purchasing decision for them.

(6)

It is desirable to base information on existing International and European Standards so as to provide a sound scientific and technical basis for the accuracy of the information provided to end-users.

(7)

The existing capacity labelling rules for portable secondary (rechargeable) and automotive batteries and accumulators need to be harmonised. Possible harmonisation of capacity labelling rules for portable primary (non-rechargeable) batteries should also be assessed.

(8)

Producers of batteries and accumulators need at least 18 months to adapt their technological processes to the new capacity labelling requirements.

(9)

The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Committee established by Article 18 of Directive 2006/12/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 5 April 2006 on waste (2),

DIRECTIVE 2006/66/EC OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL

of 6 September 2006

on batteries and accumulators and waste batteries and accumulators and repealing Directive 91/157/EEC

(Text with EEA relevance)

THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,

Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, and in particular Article 175(1) thereof and Article 95(1) thereof in relation to Articles 4, 6 and 21 of this Directive,

Having regard to the proposal from the Commission (1),

Having regard to the opinion of the European Economic and Social Committee (2),

Having regard to the opinion of the Committee of Regions (3),

Acting in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 251 of the Treaty (4), in the light of the joint text approved by the Conciliation Committee on 22 June 2006,

Whereas:

(1)

It is desirable to harmonise national measures concerning batteries and accumulators and waste batteries and accumulators. The primary objective of this Directive is to minimise the negative impact of batteries and accumulators and waste batteries and accumulators on the environment, thus contributing to the protection, preservation and improvement of the quality of the environment. The legal base is therefore Article 175(1) of the Treaty. However, it is also appropriate to take measures at Community level on the basis of Article 95(1) of the Treaty to harmonise requirements concerning the heavy metal content and labelling of batteries and accumulators and so to ensure the smooth functioning of the internal market and avoid distortion of competition within the Community.

(2)

The Commission Communication of 30 July 1996 on the Review of the Community Strategy for Waste Management established guidelines for future Community waste policy. That Communication stresses the need to reduce the quantities of hazardous substances in waste and points out the potential benefits of Community-wide rules limiting the presence of such substances in products and in production processes. It further states that, where the generation of waste cannot be avoided, that waste should be reused or recovered for its material or energy.

(3)

The Council Resolution of 25 January 1988 on a Community action programme to combat environmental pollution by cadmium (5) stressed the limitation of the uses of cadmium to cases where suitable alternatives do not exist and the collection and recycling of batteries containing cadmium as major elements of the strategy for cadmium control in the interests of the protection of human health and the environment.

(4)

Council Directive 91/157/EEC of 18 March 1991 on batteries and accumulators containing certain dangerous substances (6) has brought about an approximation of Member States' laws in this field. However, the objectives of that Directive have not been fully attained. Decision No 1600/2002/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 22 July 2002 laying down the Sixth Community Environment Action Programme (7) and Directive 2002/96/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 27 January 2003 on waste electrical and electronic equipment (WEEE) (8) also underlined the need for Directive 91/157/EEC to be revised. Directive 91/157/EEC should therefore be revised and replaced in the interests of clarity.

(5)

In order to achieve its environmental aims, this Directive prohibits the placing on the market of certain batteries and accumulators containing mercury or cadmium. It also promotes a high level of collection and recycling of waste batteries and accumulators and improved environmental performance of all operators involved in the life cycle of batteries and accumulators, e.g. producers, distributors and end-users and, in particular, those operators directly involved in the treatment and recycling of waste batteries and accumulators. The specific rules needed to do this are supplementary to existing Community legislation on waste, in particular Directive 2006/12/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 5 April 2006 on waste (9), Council Directive 1999/31/EC of 26 April 1999 on the landfill of waste (10) and Directive 2000/76/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 4 December 2000 on the incineration of waste (11).

(6)

In order to prevent waste batteries and accumulators from being discarded in such a way as to pollute the environment, and to avoid end-user confusion about the different waste management requirements for different batteries and accumulators, this Directive should apply to all batteries and accumulators placed on the market within the Community. Such a wide scope should also ensure economies of scale in collection and recycling, as well as optimal resource saving.

(7)

Reliable batteries and accumulators are fundamental for the safety of many products, appliances and services, and are an essential energy source in our society.

(8)

It is appropriate to distinguish between portable batteries and accumulators on the one hand and industrial and automotive batteries and accumulators on the other. The disposal of industrial and automotive batteries and accumulators in landfill sites or by incineration should be prohibited.

(9)

Examples of industrial batteries and accumulators include batteries and accumulators used for emergency or back-up power supply in hospitals, airports or offices, batteries and accumulators used in trains or aircraft and batteries and accumulators used on offshore oil rigs or in lighthouses. Examples also include batteries and accumulators designed exclusively for hand-held payment terminals in shops and restaurants, bar code readers in shops, professional video equipment for TV channels and professional studios, miners' lamps and diving lamps attached to mining and diving helmets for professionals, back up batteries and accumulators for electric doors to prevent them from blocking or crushing people, batteries and accumulators used for instrumentation or in various types of measurement and instrumentation equipment and batteries and accumulators used in connection with solar panel, photo-voltaic, and other renewable energy applications. Industrial batteries and accumulators also include batteries and accumulators used in electrical vehicles, such as electric cars, wheelchairs, bicycles, airport vehicles and automatic transport vehicles. In addition to this non exhaustive list of examples, any battery or accumulator that is not sealed and not automotive should be considered industrial.

(10)

Examples of portable batteries and accumulators, which are all-sealed batteries and accumulators that an average person could carry by hand without difficulty and that are neither automotive batteries or accumulators nor industrial batteries or accumulators, include single cell batteries (such as AA and AAA batteries) and batteries and accumulators used by consumers or professionals in mobile telephones, portable computers, cordless power tools, toys and household appliances such as electric toothbrushes, razors and hand-held vacuum cleaners (including similar equipment used in schools, shops, restaurants, airports, offices or hospitals) and any battery or accumulator that consumers may use for normal household applications.

(11)

The Commission should evaluate the need for adaptation of this Directive, taking account of available technical and scientific evidence. In particular, the Commission should carry out a review of the exemption from the cadmium ban provided for portable batteries and accumulators intended for use in cordless power tools. Examples of cordless power tools are tools that consumers and professionals use for turning, milling, sanding, grinding, sawing, cutting, shearing, drilling, making holes, punching, hammering, riveting, screwing, polishing or similar processing of wood, metal and other materials, as well as for mowing, cutting and other gardening activities.

(12)

The Commission should also monitor, and Member States should encourage, technological developments that improve the environmental performance of batteries and accumulators throughout their entire life cycle, including through participation in a Community eco-management and audit scheme (EMAS).

(13)

In order to protect the environment, waste batteries and accumulators should be collected. For portable batteries and accumulators, collection schemes achieving a high collection rate should be established. This means setting up collection schemes so that end-users can discard all waste portable batteries and accumulators conveniently and free of charge. Different collection schemes and financing arrangements are appropriate for the different battery and accumulator types.

(14)

It is desirable for Member States to achieve a high collection and recycling rate for waste batteries and accumulators so as to achieve a high level of environmental protection and material recovery throughout the Community. This Directive should therefore set minimum collection and recycling targets for Member States. It is appropriate to calculate the collection rate on the basis of average annual sales in preceding years, so as to have comparable targets for all Member States that are proportionate to the national level of battery and accumulator consumption.

(15)

Specific recycling requirements should be established for cadmium and lead batteries and accumulators in order to attain a high level of material recovery throughout the Community and to prevent disparities between Member States.

(16)

All interested parties should be able to participate in collection, treatment and recycling schemes. Those schemes should be designed to avoid discrimination against imported batteries and accumulators, barriers to trade or distortions of competition.

(17)

Collection and recycling schemes should be optimised, in particular in order to minimise costs and the negative environmental impact of transport. Treatment and recycling schemes should use best available techniques, as defined in Article 2(11) of Council Directive 96/61/EC of 24 September 1996 concerning integrated pollution prevention and control (12). The definition of recycling should exclude energy recovery. The concept of energy recovery is defined in other Community instruments.

(18)

Batteries and accumulators can be collected individually, by way of national battery collection schemes or together with waste electrical and electronic equipment, by way of national collection schemes set up on the basis of Directive 2002/96/EC. In the latter case, as an obligatory minimum treatment requirement, batteries and accumulators should be removed from the collected waste electrical and electronic equipment. After their removal from the waste electrical and electronic equipment, batteries and accumulators are subject to the requirements of this Directive, notably they count for achieving the collection target and are subject to recycling requirements.

(19)

Basic principles for financing the management of waste batteries and accumulators should be set at Community level. Financing schemes should help to achieve high collection and recycling rates and to give effect to the principle of producer responsibility. All producers as defined by this Directive should be registered. Producers should finance the costs of collecting, treating and recycling all collected batteries and accumulators minus the profit made by selling the materials recovered. However, under certain circumstances, the application of de minimis rules to small producers could be justified.

(20)

The provision of information to end-users on the desirability of separate collection, the collection schemes available and end-users' role in the management of waste batteries and accumulators is necessary for successful collection. Detailed arrangements should be made for a labelling system, which should provide end-users with transparent, reliable and clear information on batteries and accumulators and any heavy metals they contain.

(21)

If, in order to achieve the objectives of this Directive, and, in particular, to achieve high separate collection and recycling rates, Member States use economic instruments, such as differential tax rates, they should inform the Commission accordingly.

(22)

Reliable and comparable data on the quantities of batteries and accumulators placed on the market collected and recycled are necessary for monitoring whether the objectives of this Directive have been achieved.

(23)

Member States should lay down rules on the penalties applicable to infringements of the provisions of this Directive and ensure that they are implemented. Those penalties should be effective, proportionate and dissuasive.

(24)

In accordance with paragraph 34 of the Interinstitutional agreement on better law-making (13), Member States are encouraged to draw up, for themselves and in the interests of the Community, their own tables, which will, as far as possible, illustrate the correlation between this Directive and the transposition measures and to make them public.

(25)

The measures necessary for the implementation of this Directive should be adopted in accordance with Council Decision 1999/468/EC of 28 June 1999 laying down the procedures for the exercise of implementing powers conferred on the Commission (14).

(26)

Since the objectives of this Directive namely protecting the environment and ensuring the proper functioning of the internal market cannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member States and can therefore, by reason of the scale or effects of the action, be better achieved at Community level, the Community may adopt measures, in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity as set out in Article 5 of the Treaty. In accordance with the principle of proportionality, as set out in that Article, this Directive does not go beyond what is necessary in order to achieve those objectives.

(27)

This Directive applies without prejudice to Community legislation on safety, quality and health requirements and specific Community waste management legislation, in particular Directive 2000/53/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 18 September 2000 on end-of-life vehicles (15) and Directive 2002/96/EC.

(28)

As regards producer responsibility, producers of batteries and accumulators and producers of other products incorporating a battery or accumulator are responsible for the waste management of batteries and accumulators that they place on the market. A flexible approach is appropriate to enable financing schemes to reflect differing national circumstances and to take account of existing schemes, particularly those set up to comply with Directives 2000/53/EC and 2002/96/EC, while avoiding double charging.

(29)

Directive 2002/95/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 27 January 2003 on the restriction of the use of certain hazardous substances in electrical and electronic equipment (16) does not apply to batteries and accumulators used in electrical and electronic equipment.

(30)

Automotive and industrial batteries and accumulators used in vehicles should meet the requirements of Directive 2000/53/EC, in particular Article 4 thereof. Therefore the use of cadmium in industrial batteries and accumulators for electrical vehicles should be prohibited, unless they can benefit from an exemption on the basis of Annex II to that Directive,
